After this, we will cover unique and shared pointers. The module ends with a number of exercises to make you familiar with the use of smart pointers. \n"},"analysis/newf2/intro.html":{"url":"analysis/newf2/intro.html","title":"Pointers, the absolute basics","keywords":"","body":"The absolute basics\nOf course, all of us remember from our C++ 101 class what a pointer is. Still, it cannot hurt to refresh the basics a little bit before we dive into the deep end. \n\nWhen a variable is declared, the memory needed to store its value is assigned a specific location in memory: its memory address. \nC++ programs do not actively decide the exact memory addresses where its variables are stored. \n\nFortunately, that task is left to the environment where the program is run - generally, an operating system that decides the particular memory locations on runtime. However, it may be useful for a program to be able to obtain the address of a variable during runtime in order to access data cells that are at a certain position relative to it.\nThe address-of operator &\nThe address of a variable can be obtained by preceding the name of a variable with an ampersand sign (&), known as address-of operator. For example: \nfoo = &myfar;\n\nThis assigns the address of variable myvar to foo; by preceding the name of the variable myvar with the address-of operator (&), we are no longer assigning the content of the variable itself to foo, but its address.\n RuntimeThe actual address of a variable in memory cannot be known before runtime, but let's assume, in order to help clarify some concepts, that myvar is placed during runtime in the memory address 1776.\n\nConsider the following code fragment\nmyvar = 25;\nfoo = &myvar;\nbar = myvar;\n\n\nFirst, we have assigned the value 25 to myvar (a variable whose address in memory we assumed to be 1776).\n\nThe second statement assigns foo the address of myvar, which we have assumed to be 1776.\n\nFinally, the third statement, assigns the value contained in myvar to bar. This is a standard assignment operation, as already done many times in earlier chapters.\n\n\n\nThe main difference between the second and third statements is the appearance of the address-of operator (&).\n PointersThe variable that stores the address of another variable (like foo in the previous example) is what in C++ is called a pointer. Pointers are said to \"point to\" the variable whose address they store.\n\nDereference operator *\nPointers can be used to access the variable they point to directly. This is done by preceding the pointer name with the dereference operator (*). The operator itself can be read as \"value pointed to by\".\nTherefore, following with the values of the previous example, the following statement: \nbaz = *foo\n\nThis could be read as: \"baz equal to value pointed to by foo\", and the statement would actually assign the value 25 to baz, since foo is 1776, and the value pointed to by 1776 (following the example above) would be 25.\n\nIt is important to clearly differentiate that foo refers to the value 1776, while *foo (with an asterisk * preceding the identifier) refers to the value stored at address 1776, which in this case is 25. Notice the difference of including or not including the dereference operator \nbaz = foo;   // baz equal to foo (1776)\nbaz = *foo;  // baz equal to value pointed to by foo (25)\n\nThe reference and dereference operators are thus complementary:\n\n& is the address-of operator, and can be read simply as \"address of\"\n* is the dereference operator, and can be read as \"value pointed to by\"\n\nThus, they have sort of opposite meanings: An address obtained with & can be dereferenced with *.\n Example of pointersWhat will this program return ? \n#include \nusing namespace std;\n\nint main ()\n{\n  int firstvalue = 5, secondvalue = 15;\n  int * p1, * p2;\n\n  p1 = &firstvalue;  // p1 = address of firstvalue\n  p2 = &secondvalue; // p2 = address of secondvalue\n  *p1 = 10;          // value pointed to by p1 = 10\n  *p2 = *p1;         // value pointed to by p2 = value pointed to by p1\n  p1 = p2;           // p1 = p2 (value of pointer is copied)\n  *p1 = 20;          // value pointed to by p1 = 20\n\n  cout \n  SolutionClick to expandThe solution is\nfirstvalue is 10\nsecondvalue is 20\n\n\nVoid pointers\nThe void type of pointer is a special type of pointer that represents the absence of type. Void pointers are pointers that point to a value that has no type , an undetermined length and undetermined dereferencing properties.\nVoid pointers are flexible:  by being able to point to any data type, from an integer value or a float to a string of characters. In exchange, they have a great limitation: the data pointed to by them cannot be directly dereferenced.\n  Dereferencing void pointersWhy can't a void pointer directly be dereferenced? \n SolutionClick to expandSince void pointers have no type to dereference to, any address in a void pointer needs to be transformed into some other pointer type that points to a concrete data type before being dereferenced.\n\nUsage of void pointers\nOne of its possible uses may be to pass generic parameters to a function. We will later see (in the parallellisation section) that this comes in handy, but here is already an example.  \n What does this code do?One of the possible uses of void pointers is passing generic parameters to a function:\n// increaser\n#include \nusing namespace std;\n\nvoid increase (void* data, int psize)\n{\n  if ( psize == sizeof(char) )\n  { char* pchar; pchar=(char*)data; ++(*pchar); }\n  else if (psize == sizeof(int) )\n  { int* pint; pint=(int*)data; ++(*pint); }\n}\n\nint main ()\n{\n  char a = 'x';\n  int b = 1602;\n  increase (&a,sizeof(a));\n  increase (&b,sizeof(b));\n  cout \n Solution Click to expandThe solution is\ny, 1603\n\n\nPointers to functions\nC++ allows operations with pointers to functions. \n\nThe typical use of this is for passing a function as an argument to another function. \nPointers to functions are declared with the same syntax as a regular function declaration, except that the name of the function is enclosed between parentheses () and an asterisk (*) is inserted before the name\n\nThe easiest way to familiarize yourself with function pointers is to look at an example:\n  Function pointers This is an example of a function pointer\n// pointer to functions\n#include \nusing namespace std;\n\nint addition (int a, int b) { \n  return (a+b); \n}\n\nint subtraction (int a, int b) { \n  return (a-b); \n}\n\nint operation (int x, int y, int (*functocall)(int,int)) {\n  int g;\n  g = (*functocall)(x,y);\n  return (g);\n}\n\nint main () {\n  int m,n;\n  int (*minus)(int,int) = subtraction;\n\n  m = operation (7, 5, addition);\n  n = operation (20, m, minus);\n  cout \n  SolutionClick to expandAnd the output is\n8\n\n\nAgain, we will see, when we are multi-processing and multi-threading our code, how function pointers can be very handy. \n FunctorsDespite the names being very similar, function pointers are not the same as functors. Functors, instead, are \nobject functions. Take a look at the following example:\nstruct add_x {\n  add_x(int x) : x(x) {}\n  int operator()(int y) const { return x + y; }\n\nprivate:\n  int x;\n};\n\nThe above code snippet defines a functor. There are a couple of nice things about functors. One is that unlike regular functions, they can contain a state. The above example creates a function which adds 42 to whatever you give it. But that value 42 is not hardcoded, it was specified as a constructor argument when we created our functor instance. You could create another adder, which added 27, just by calling the constructor with a different value. This makes them nicely customizable.\n// Now you can use it like this:\nadd_x add42(42); // create an instance of the functor class\nint i = add42(8); // and \"call\" it\nassert(i == 50); // and it added 42 to its argument\n\nstd::vector in; // assume this contains a bunch of values)\nstd::vector out(in.size());\n// Pass a functor to std::transform, which calls the functor on every element \n// in the input sequence, and stores the result to the output sequence\nstd::transform(in.begin(), in.end(), out.begin(), add_x(1)); \nassert(out[i] == in[i] + 1); // for all i\n\nAs the last lines show, you often pass functors as arguments to other functions such as std::transform or the other standard library algorithms. You could do the same with a regular function pointer except, as I said above, functors can be \"customized\" because they contain state, making them more flexible; if you wanted to use a function pointer, you'd have to write a function which added exactly 1 to its argument. \nThe functor is general, and potentially more efficient. In the above example, the compiler knows exactly which function std::transform should call. It should call add_x::operator() and can inline that function call. If you had passed a function pointer instead, the compiler couldn't immediately see which function it points to, so it has to dereference the pointer at runtime, and then make the call.\n\nDynamic memory\nAll memory needs are determined before program execution by defining the variables needed. But there may be cases where the memory needs of a program can only be determined during runtime. For example, when the memory needed depends on user input. On these cases, programs need to dynamically allocate memory, for which the C++ language integrates the operators new and delete.\nOperators new and new[]\nDynamic memory is allocated using operator new. new is followed by a data type specifier and, if a sequence of more than one element is required, the number of these within brackets []. It returns a pointer to the beginning of the new block of memory allocated. Its syntax is: \n\npointer = new type\npointer = new type [number_of_elements]\n\nThe first expression is used to allocate memory to contain one single element of type type. The second one is used to allocate a block (an array) of elements of type type, where number_of_elements is an integer value representing the amount of these. For example:\nOperators delete and delete[]\nIn most cases, memory allocated dynamically is only needed during specific periods of time within a program; once it is no longer needed, it can be freed so that the memory becomes available again for other requests of dynamic memory. This is the purpose of operator delete, whose syntax is:\n\ndelete pointer;\ndelete[] pointer;\n\nThe first statement releases the memory of a single element allocated using new, and the second one releases the memory allocated for arrays of elements using new and a size in brackets ([]).\nThe value passed as argument to delete shall be either a pointer to a memory block previously allocated with new, or a null pointer (in the case of a null pointer, delete produces no effect).\nPictures say more than a 1000 words, so here's a few pictures that we shamelessly stole .... : \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dynamic memory in CC++ integrates the operators new and delete for allocating dynamic memory. But these were not available in the C language; instead, it used a library solution, with the functions malloc, calloc, realloc and free, defined in the header  (known as  in C). The functions are also available in C++ and can also be used to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory.\nNote, though, that the memory blocks allocated by these functions are not necessarily compatible with those returned by new, so they should not be mixed; each one should be handled with its own set of functions or operators.\n\nExercises\nThese are some very basic exercises to refresh you on the basics of pointers. First, go through the problems that were covered in the lecture. If you are interested in learning some more, take a look at the questions below. These questions do not require coding, the snippets of code serve as exapmle to the text (but of course you are free to try them out 'in the wild'). \n  Question Considering only performance, when should you pass small objects by value, reference and pointer?\nstruct SmallStruct { int i };\n\nvoid foo(SmallStruct s);\nvoid foo(SmallStruct& s);\nvoid foo(SmallStruct* s);\n\n  Solution Click to expandThere was no significant performance difference between passing small objects (or built-ins) by value, reference, or pointer.\n\n  Question Considering only performance, when should you pass large objects by value, reference and pointer?\nstruct LargeStruct { std::vector i };\n\nvoid foo(LargeStruct s);\nvoid foo(LargeStruct& s);\nvoid foo(LargeStruct* s);\n\n  Solution Click to expandPassing by value is the slowest since Foo's copy constructor is invoked for each call. Passing by reference or by pointer essentially copy a machine word — there's no significant difference.\n\n  Question Are there other reasons to prefer one argument-passing mechanism to another (i.e. passing by value, reference or pointer)?\n  Solution Click to expandThe difference between writing -> versus . is trivial. More important is the semantic difference between them.  Consider the following method:\nvoid foo(MyLargObj* p)\n{\n    p->bar();\n}\n\nPerhaps when you first wrote foo, you knew that p would always be valid, but in reality, programs are complex, and inevitably, someone (maybe you) will pass NULL.  You might then feel the need to check p\nvoid foo(MyLargObj* p)\n{\n    if (!p)\n        return;\n    p->bar();\n}\n\nSo passing by pointer, allows for writing functions in which the arguments have invalid values. So, if passing in a value is truly optional, passing by pointer may be appropriate. \nIf a precondition of the function requires no invalid values, consider pass-by-reference or pass-by-value — this more explicitly declares the domain of a given function.  Foo becomes:\nvoid foo(MyLargObj& p)\n{\n    p.bar();\n}\n\nWhich declares via the input type that invalid values for p are not allowed.  Passing by value may also be reasonable, but it depends on if changes to an object should be visible after the function is complete.\nA final consideration is that pointers carry a notion of ownership. Pointers often point to non-stack allocated objects (e.g., allocated using new), and should be deallocated when no longer needed. Lots of comments can be written indicating ownership — \"Ownership must be passed to this function, it will call delete,\" etc. Using references or values can reduce such error-prone commenting burden since they convey no notion of ownership. (Another way to address this, smart pointers, will be covered later. The discussion on the semantic differences between passing by reference and by value still applies in that case, however.)\n\n  Question What happens when passing a derived object as a base object?\nclass Base\n{\n    public:\n        virtual ~Base() {}\n        virtual void foo() const { std::cout foo(); }\n...\nDerived d;\nbar1(d);\nbar2(d);\nbar3(&d);\n\n  Solution Click to expandAll calls do not produce identical output — when a derived object is passed by value, only the 'base' copy constructor is called. Things that are not copied include the ability to call derived object virtual functions.

As you probably know, dynamic memory management can bring quite some headaches, such as\n\nmemory leaks, when allocated memory is not deallocated\nownership issues: who is in charge of deallocating memory? \n\nLuckily, C++11 comes with smart pointers, aimed at helping you out in exactly those situations. \n PointersA pointer is an object whose value “points to” another value stored\nsomewhere else in memory\n\nit contains a memory address\nobtaining the stored at the pointed location\nvery flexible and powerful tool\n\n\nPitfalls of pointers\nLet's look at some use cases of pointers:\n Declaring a pointer - what's wrong?     int* a; // declares a pointer that can point to an integer value\n\n SolutionClick to expandThe pointer points to a random address in memory! To avoid this, always initialize to NULL:\n    int* b = nullptr; // OK, pointer is initialised to a null memory address\n\n\nWe can use pointers to allocate memory on the heap\n    int* c = new int; // allocate memory for an integer value in the heap\n    //and assign its memory address to this pointer\n\n  What does this do?    int** d = &a;\n\n SolutionClick to expandThis points to a pointer ...\n    int** d = &a; // this pointer points to a pointer to an integer value\n\nBecause, why not?\n\nAnd then there are of course pointers to objects \n    MyObject* e = new MyObject(); // allocate memory for MyObject\n    // and assign its memory address to the pointer e\n\n    /* Using a pointer */\n    int f = *c; // dereferencing a pointer and assigning the pointed\n    // value to another integer variable\n\n    e->DoSomething(); // dereferencing a pointer and calling\n    // the method DoSomething() of the instance of MyObject\n    // pointed by e\n\nMemory leaks\nmemory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when a computer program incorrectly manages memory allocations in such a way that memory which is no longer needed is not released. A memory leak may also happen when an object is stored in memory but cannot be accessed by the running code. A memory leak has symptoms similar to a number of other problems and generally can only be diagnosed by a programmer with access to the program's source code. \n  What is the problem with this code?Below is a snippet of analysis code. What is wrong with it ? \n    void MyAnalysisTask::UserExec()\n    {\n      TLorentzVector* v = nullptr;\n      for (int i = 0; i GetNumberOfTracks(); i++) {\n        AliVTrack* track = InputEvent()->GetTrack(i);\n        if (!track) continue;\n        v = new TLorentzVector(track->Px(), \n          track->Py(), track->Pz(), track->M());\n\n        // my analysis here\n        std::cout Pt() \n SolutionClick to expandLook at the line\nv = new TLorentzVector(track->Px(), \n\nFor each iteration the loop, a new instance of TLorentzVector is created. Only the last instance is deleted via the delete call at the end of the code. The memory of the other instances is not deleted, and cannot be deleted anymore (the pointers to it are overwritten in the loop). \n\nArray or single value?\nBesides being at a risk of memory leaks, pointers can lead to truly ambiguous situations when using arrays, since a pointer can point to a single value or to an array, there is  no way to infer it from its declaration. There is a different syntax to destroy (= deallocate, free) the pointed object for arrays and single objects as we have seen in the previous section. Look at the following snippet of code, that illustrates this ambiguity: \n    AliVTrack* FilterTracks();\n\n    void UserExec()\n    {\n      TLorentzVector *vect = new TLorentzVector(0,0,0,0);\n      double *trackPts = new double[100];\n      AliVTrack *returnValue = FilterTracks();\n\n      // here use the pointers\n\n      delete vect;\n      delete[] trackPts;\n      delete returnValue; // or should I use delete[] ??\n    }\n\nOwnership issues: double deletes\n\nEach memory allocation should match a corresponding deallocation\n\nDifficult to keep track of all memory allocations/deallocations in a\nlarge project\n\nOwnership of the pointed memory is ambiguous: multiple deletes\nof the same object may occur\n\n\n    AliVTrack* FilterTracks();\n    void AnalyzeTracks(AliVTrack* tracks);\n\n    void MyAnalysisTask::UserExec()\n    {\n      AliVTrack* tracks = FilterTracks();\n\n      AnalyzeTracks(tracks);\n\n      delete[] tracks; // should I actually delete it?? \n      //or was it already deleted by AnalyzeTracks?\n    }\n\nSmart Pointers\n\nClear (shared or exclusive) ownership of the pointed object\n\nmemory is deallocated when the last pointer goes out of scope\n\nAvailable since C++11\n\n\nExclusive-Ownership Pointers: unique_ptr\n\nAutomatic garbage collection with (i.e. it uses the same\nresources as a raw pointer)\n\nunique_ptr owns the object it points\n\nMemory automatically released when unique_ptr goes out of scope or\nwhen its reset(T* ptr) method is called\n\nOnly one unique_ptr can point to the same memory address\n\n\n Unique pointers in the wildExample 1\n    void MyFunction() {\n      std::unique_ptr vector(new TLorentzVector(0,0,0,0));\n      std::unique_ptr vector2(new TLorentzVector(0,0,0,0));\n\n      // use vector and vector2\n\n      // dereferencing unique_ptr works exactly as a raw pointer\n      std::cout Pt() \nExample 2\n    void MyAnalysisTask::UserExec()\n    {\n      for (int i = 0; i GetNumberOfTracks(); i++) {\n        AliVTrack* track = InputEvent()->GetTrack(i);\n        if (!track) continue;\n        std::unique_ptr v(new TLorentzVector(track->Px(), \n          track->Py(), track->Pz(), track->M()));\n\n        // my analysis here\n        std::cout Pt() \nNo memory leak here! :)\n\nShared-Ownership Pointers: shared_ptr\n\nAutomatic garbage collection with some CPU and memory overhead\n\nThe pointed object is collectively owned by one or more\nshared_ptr instances\n\nMemory automatically released the last shared_ptr goes out of\nscope or when it is re-assigned\n\n\n\n Shared pointers in the wildExample 1\n    void MyFunction() {\n      std::shared_ptr vector(new TLorentzVector(0,0,0,0));\n      std::shared_ptr vector2(new TLorentzVector(0,0,0,0));\n\n      // dereferencing shared_ptr works exactly as a raw pointer\n      std::cout Pt() \nExample 2\n    class MyClass {\n      public:\n        MyClass();\n      private:\n        void MyFunction();\n        std::shared_ptr fVector;\n    };\n\n    void MyClass::MyFunction() {\n      std::shared_ptr vector(new TLorentzVector(0,0,0,0));\n\n      // assignment is allowed between shared_ptr instances\n      fVector = vector;\n      // the object previously pointed by fVector (if any) is deleted\n      // vector and fVector now share the ownership of the same object\n\n      // here vector goes out-of-scope\n      // however fVector is a class member so the object is not deleted!\n      // it will be deleted automatically when this instance of the class\n      // is deleted (and therefore fVector goes out-of-scope) :)\n    }\n\n\nSome word of caution on `shared_ptr'\n What is the problem in this case?You have created smart code, using smart pointers.

Click on 'solution' to see the answer to the questions. You can put the questions 'in action' by writing small C++ programs, but they are also answerable by just inspecting the code snippets.  \n QuestionThe following contains a mistake.  Fix it, and explain why it was wrong.\nstd::shared_ptr p1(new int(42));\nstd::shared_ptr p2(p1.get());\n\n SolutionClick to expandp1 and p2 will both attempt to delete the same pointer, without knowing the other exists.  A shared_ptr counts the number of pointers referencing the same pointer and deallocates that pointer once no one is referencing it.  With code like the previous, we get the following:\nstd::shared_ptr p1(new int(42));//p1 references the new pointer, reference count = 1\nstd::shared_ptr p2(p1.get());//p2 thinks it's the only guy looking at the pointer, reference count = 1\n//(automatically called) p2.~shared_ptr() -- deletes the pointer in p2\n//(automatically called) p1.~shared_ptr() -- Oops, p1's pointer was already deleted!\n\nThe correct way to ensure the reference counts are correct is to copy the shared_ptr, not just the underlying pointer:\nstd::shared_ptr p1(new int(42));//p1 references the new pointer, reference count = 1\nstd::shared_ptr p2(p1);//p2 references p1's pointer & p1's reference count, reference count = 2\n//(automatically called) p2.~shared_ptr() -- decrements the reference count ( = 1 )\n//(automatically called) p1.~shared_ptr() -- decrements the reference count to zero and deletes the pointer.\n\n\n QuestionThe following contains a mistake.  Fix it, and explain why it was wrong.\nstd::unique_ptr p3(new int[42]);\n\n SolutionClick to expandstd::unique_ptr will call delete on its pointer -- that means the pointer should be allocated using new.  If we want to use new[N], we should store it in std::unique_ptr, which will correctly call delete[].  Furthermore, it offers operator[] and disallows operator* & operator->, which makes it less awkward to index elements after the first.\n\n QuestionWhen would you use a unique_ptr versus a shared_ptr?\n SolutionClick to expandUse shared_ptr when you know that ownership of the pointer must be shared in more than one place.  Note that ownership == responsability to deallocate the pointer.\nUse unique_ptr when you don't know that ownership of the pointer must be shared.\n\n QuestionSuppose you have a class which returns a pointer which the user may wish to store in a shared_ptr.  What type should you return?\n SolutionClick to expandReturn a unique_ptr to that type.  unique_ptrs are convertible to shared_ptrs, so returning a unique_ptr prevents memory leaks without restricting how that pointer is used later.\nReturning a raw pointer instead would certainly work, but goes against, e.g., Scott Meyers's advice to \"make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly.\"  (See Item 18 of Effective C++.)\n\n QuestionThe following code opens a handle to a file using the C-style FILE* interface\nand closes the handle before returning.\n\n  FILE* pFin = NULL;\n  try\n  {\n    std::string filename(\"c:\\\\Windows\\\\win.ini\");\n    pFin = std::fopen(filename.c_str(), \"r\");\n    if (!pFin)\n      return;\n\n    char data[10];\n    if (std::fread(data, 1, 10, pFin) \nWe could change it to use\niostreams, but for this exercise, change the code to just use a smart\npointer (std::shared_ptr) to FILE with a custom deleter, so that the\nfclose() call doesn't have to appear in so many places, and eliminate the\ntry-catch block.\n SolutionClick to expand:\n    std::string filename(\"c:\\\\Windows\\\\win.ini\");\n    std::shared_ptr pFin(std::fopen(filename.c_str(), \"r\"), &std::fclose);\n    if (!pFin)\n      return;\n\n    char data[10];\n    if (std::fread(data, 1, 10, pFin.get()) \nNotice that not only do the fclose() calls go away, but also the try/catch block goes away, since there's no longer a need to call fclose() and then re-throw.\n\n Questionauto p_unique = get_unique_ptr(my_lib.open_handle(),\n[&](int* p_handle) { my_lib.close_handle(p_handle); });\n\n//Now suppose we need to change to a shared_ptr:\nstd::shared_ptr p_shared(p_unique.release());\n\nWhat's wrong with the conversion to shared_ptr and why does it cause a\ncrash?\n SolutionClick to expandThe custom deleter is not transferred from the unique_ptr to the shared_ptr when you use release().  Therefore, when the shared_ptr goes out of scope, it calls delete on the raw pointer instead of the custom deleter.\n\n QuestionThe fix for the above looks like this:\nstd::shared_ptr p_shared(std::move(p_unique));\n\nRewrite the code above. Why do you have to use std::move()?\n SolutionClick to expand:\nunique_ptr cannot be copied, as that would not provide unique ownership\nof the pointer.  unique_ptr can be moved from.  This allows unique_ptr to\nbe returned from functions, used in std containers, and more.  std::move\nexplicitly moves the pointer out of p_unique into p_shared.\n\n QuestionWhen we copied a shared_ptr to another shared_ptr, we didn't have to use\nstd::move(). Why not?\n SolutionClick to expandBecause shared_ptrs are copy assignable whereas unique_ptrs are not.  With\na unique_ptr, we have to help transfer ownership through the move because\nownership can not be copied.\nIt seems that explicitly calling std::move is usually only necessary when\nwriting move constructors and move assignment operators.  (There are other\ncases, like when writing algorithms, but moves are usually safest\n(and fastest!) when implicitly generated.)\n\n Question//We have a unique_ptr to const and we want to switch to a unique_ptr to\n// non-const:\nstd::unique_ptr p_const_unique(new int(5));\n//std::unique_ptr p_my_non_const_int(std::move(p_const_unique));\n\nIf you uncomment the line above, it won't compile.  Why not?\n SolutionClick to expandJust as with raw pointers, converting a pointer to const to a pointer to\nnon-const will fail.\nFrom a higher-level point of view, if this conversion were allowed, \nthen the following could happen.\nstd::unique_ptr p_const_unique(new int(5));\nstd::unique_ptr p_my_non_const_int(std::move(p_const_unique));\n// We are changing the value of something originally declared const!\n*p_my_non_const_int = 4;\n\n\n QuestionConsider the following code:\nint foo() { throw std::runtime_error(\"Normally conditional\");  return 5; }\n\nvoid bar(std::shared_ptr int, int val)\n{}\n\nvoid example2()\n{\n  bar(std::shared_ptr(new int(42)), foo());\n}\n\nWhy could calling example2 result in a memory leak?\n SolutionClick to expandC++ arguments may be evaluated in unspecified order.  In the previous, the shared_ptr constructor and foo() must both be evaluated before bar is called, but there is no requirement that the shared_ptr constructor be called before foo() is evaluated.  Thus the order of operations could be:\nnew int(42)\nfoo()\nand the shared_ptr constructor might never be called, as foo() threw and exception.\n\n"},"analysis/parallellism.html":{"url":"analysis/parallellism.html","title":"Part 4 - Parallellism","keywords":"","body":"Parallellism\nParallellism is not only a difficult word to spell properly, but writing code aimed at safe and efficient parallell execution can also be a daunting task.

The implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems, but in most cases a thread is a component of a process. \n\n\nMultiple threads can exist within one process\nThey execute concurrently and share resources such as memory \nDifferent processes do not share these resources\nThe threads of a process share its executable code and the values of its variables at any given time\nSo, to sum up\n\nProcesses are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process\n\nProcesses carry considerably more state information than threads, whereas multiple threads within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources\nProcesses have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space\nProcesses interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms\nContext switching between threads in the same process is typically faster than context switching between processes.\n\nMultithreading\nSingle threading means (obviously) executing one single thread at a time. Multithreading allows multiple threads to exist within the context of one process. These threads share the process's resources, but are able to execute independently. \nAdvantages\n\nResponsiveness: multithreading can allow an application to remain responsive to input. \nIn a one-thread program, if the main execution thread blocks on a long-running task, the entire application can appear to freeze. \nMoving the task to a worker thread,  it is possible for the application to remain responsive to user input while executing tasks in the background\nNote: most cases multithreading is not the only way to keep a program responsive, with non-blocking I/O and/or Unix signals being available for gaining similar results\n\n\nFaster execution: multithreaded program allow faster operation on computer systems that have multiple CPUs or one or more multi-core processors, or across a cluster of machines\nworks only if the threads are independent, i.e. do not have to wait for one another\n\n\nLower resource consumption: using threads, an application can serve multiple clients concurrently using fewer resources than it would need when using multiple process copies of itself. \nFor example, the Apache HTTP server uses thread pools: a pool of listener threads for listening to incoming requests, and a pool of server threads for processing those requests.\n\n\nBetter system utilization: as an example, a file system using multiple threads can achieve higher throughput and lower latency since data in a faster medium (such as cache memory) can be retrieved by one thread while another thread retrieves data from a slower medium (such as external storage) with neither thread waiting for the other to finish.\nSimplified sharing and communication: unlike processes, which require a message passing or shared memory mechanism to perform inter-process communication (IPC), threads can communicate through data, code and files they already share.\nParallelization: applications looking to use multicore or multi-CPU systems can use multithreading to split data and tasks into parallel subtasks and let the underlying architecture manage how the threads run, either concurrently on one core or in parallel on multiple cores. \n\nDrawbacks\n\nSynchronization: since threads share the same address space, the programmer must be careful to avoid race conditions and other non-intuitive behaviors. \nIn order for data to be correctly manipulated, threads will often need to rendezvous in time in order to process the data in the correct order. \n\n\nThreads may also require mutually exclusive operations (often implemented using mutexes) in order to prevent common data from being simultaneously modified or read while in the process of being modified\nThread crashes a process: an illegal operation performed by a thread crashes the entire process; therefore, one misbehaving thread can disrupt the processing of all the other threads in the application.\n\n Race conditions and mutexesThreads in the same process share the same address space. This allows concurrently running code to efficiently  exchange data without the overhead or complexity of an IPC. When shared between threads, however, even simple data structures become prone to race conditions if they require more than one CPU instruction to update: two threads may end up attempting to update the data structure at the same time and find it unexpectedly changing underfoot. Bugs caused by race conditions can be very difficult to reproduce and isolate.\n\nLet's look at this in practice and assume that two threads want to increment the value of a global integer variable by one. Ideally, the following sequence of operations would take place\n\nHowever, if the two threads run simultaneously without locking or synchronization, the outcome of the operation could be wrong\n\nTo prevent this, threading application programming interfaces (APIs) offer synchronization primitives such as\n mutexes to lock data structures against concurrent access. \nMutex is a portmanteau of 'mutual exclusion': one thread of execution never enter its critical section at the same time that another concurrent thread of execution enters its own critical section.\n\nOn uniprocessor systems, a thread running into a locked mutex must sleep and hence trigger a context switch\nOn multi-processor systems, the thread may instead poll the mutex in a spinlock which intermittently checks if the mutex has been released\n\nSeveral mutexes exist, one that you often see\n\nLocks (usually just called mutex), behaving as described above\nSemaphores: simple data types. Consider a variable A and a boolean variable S. A is only accessed when S is marked true. Thus, S is a semaphore for A\nand many more (but we are not computer scientists)\n\nMutexes make your code safe for race conditions, but as a trade-off, they can lead to deadlocks. A deadlock is a state in which each member of a group is waiting for some other member to take action, such as sending a message or more commonly releasing a lock. \n\nConversely, one can also run into a livelock, where  the states of the processes involved in the livelock constantly change with regard to one another, none progressing. \nMost OSs cannot prevent deadlocks!\n\nHopefully, by now, you have a good idea of what multi threading and multi processing entails, what are the benefits, and what are the difficulties. Let's write our own little multi threader program now!\n"},"analysis/parallell/example.html":{"url":"analysis/parallell/example.html","title":"Posix multithreading","keywords":"","body":"POSIX multi-threading\nC++ does not contain any built-in support for multithreaded applications. Instead, it relies entirely upon the operating system to provide this feature.\nThis tutorial assumes that you are working on Linux OS and we are going to write multi-threaded C++ program using POSIX. POSIX Threads, or Pthreads provides API which are available on many Unix-like POSIX systems such as GNU/Linux, Mac OS X.\n POSIXThe Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) is a family of standards specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems. POSIX defines the application programming interface (API), along with command line shells and utility interfaces, for software compatibility with variants of Unix and other operating systems.\n\nCreating threads\nThe following routine is used to create a POSIX thread\n#include \npthread_create (thread, attr, start_routine, arg)\n\nHere, pthread_create creates a new thread and makes it executable. This routine can be called any number of times from anywhere within your code. The arguments of the function are the following\n\nthread: a unique identifier for the new thread returned by the subroutine\nattr: an attribute object that may be used to set thread attributes. You can specify NULL for the default values.     \nstart_routine: the C++ routine that the thread will execute once it is created\narg: A single argument that may be passed to start_routine. It must be passed by reference as a pointer cast of type void. NULL may be used if no argument is to be passed\n\nThe maximum number of threads that may be created by a process is implementation dependent. Once created, threads are peers, and may create other threads. There is no implied hierarchy or dependency between threads.\nTerminating threads\nTo terminate a POSIX thread, do\n#include \npthread_exit (status)\n\nHere pthread_exit is used to explicitly exit a thread. Typically, the pthread_exit() routine is called after a thread has completed its work and is no longer required to exist.\nIf main() finishes before the threads it has created, and exits with pthread_exit(), the other threads will continue to execute. Otherwise, they will be automatically terminated when main() finishes.\nExample\nThis simple example code creates 5 threads with the pthread_create() routine. Each thread prints a \"Hello World!\" message, and then terminates with a call to pthread_exit(). \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define NUM_THREADS 5\n\nvoid *PrintHello(void *threadid) {\n   long tid;\n   tid = (long)threadid;\n   cout \nCompile the following program using -lpthread library as follows \ng++ test.cpp -lpthread\n\nNow, execute your program which gives the following output\n[rbertens@tatooiine tutorial]$ ./a.out \nmain() : creating thread, 0\nmain() : creating thread, 1\nHello World! Thread ID, 0\nmain() : creating thread, 2\nHello World! Thread ID, 1\nmain() : creating thread, 3\nmain() : creating thread, 4\nHello World! Thread ID, 2\nHello World! Thread ID, 3\nHello World! Thread ID, 4\n\nAs you can see, the threads executed in no particular order. \nPassing Arguments to Threads\nThis example shows how to pass multiple arguments via a structure. You can pass any data type in a thread callback because it points to void as explained in the following example\n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\n#define NUM_THREADS 5\n\nstruct thread_data {\n   int  thread_id;\n   char *message;\n};\n\nvoid *PrintHello(void *threadarg) {\n   struct thread_data *my_data;\n   my_data = (struct thread_data *) threadarg;\n\n   cout thread_id ;\n   cout message \nWhen the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result −\n[rbertens@tatooiine tutorial]$ ./a.out \nmain() : creating thread, 0\nmain() : creating thread, 1\nThread ID : 0 Message : This is message\nmain() : creating thread, 2\nThread ID : 1 Message : This is message\nmain() : creating thread, 3\nThread ID : 2 Message : This is message\nmain() : creating thread, 4\nThread ID : 3 Message : This is message\nThread ID : 4 Message : This is message\n\nAs we learned before, void pointers are very powerful! \nJoining and detaching threads\nAs we have seen before, threads execute independent from one another. For a program flow however, you might want to make sure that a given thread (or a pool of threads) have executed, before your program continues. Here, joining and detaching comes in handy. \nA thread can run in two modes: \n\nJoinable mode (default). A joinable thread will not release any resource even after the end of thread function, until some other thread calls pthread_join() with its ID. \nDetached mode. A Detached thread automatically releases it allocated resources on exit. No other thread needs to join it. \n\nThe detached attribute merely determines the behavior of the system when the thread terminates; it does not prevent the thread from being terminated if the process terminates using exit (or equivalently, if the main thread returns). The pthread_detach() function marks the thread identified by thread as detached. When a detached thread terminates, its resources are automatically released back to the system without the need for another thread to join with the terminated thread.\nThere are following two routines which we can use to join or detach threads\npthread_join (threadid, status) \npthread_detach (threadid)\n\nIn practice, an example of using joinable threads is e.g.\n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\n#include \n\nvoid * threadFunc(void * arg)\n{\n    std::cout \nconversely, with detached threads, one can write\n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\n#include \n\nvoid * threadFunc(void * arg)\n{\n    std::cout \n OpenMP and C++11 std::threadPOSIX mutli threading is powerful, but not exactly easy. Two other approaches are mentioned here for completeness, they are easier to implement. \nThread support in std in C++11\nSince C++11, the std library offers thread support:\nvoid thread_main() {\n    std::cout \nOpenMP\nA relatively easy way to achieve multi threading is using OpenMP, which uses compiler pragma's to do the dirty work for you:\n#include \n#include \n\nint main(void)\n{\n    #pragma omp parallel\n    printf(\"Hello, world.\\n\");\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\nwhen compiling the above code snippet, prepend -fopenmp as compiler flag! The pragma directives will be expanded in proper C++ code before translation into machine code. Hence, executing the above code on e.g. a 4 core machine would result in\nHello, world.\nHello, world.\nHello, world.\nHello, world.\n\n(although, since the threads all share the same standard output, it's more likely that you end up in a race condition and see something like Hello, wHello, woorld.rld.Hello, wHello, woorld.rld.....)\n\nExercises\nFirst of all, try to go through the examples that were shown in the lecture: copy the code snippets, and try to compile and execute them. You can also\n\ngive the threads some more work, e.g. make a computationally intensive loop\nuse your system monitor to keep track of CPU/core usage\ncan you demonstrate that multi threading actually speeds up execution? \n\nSecondly, we have talked a lot about race conditions and deadlocks\n\ncan you write your own race condition? Hint: problems often occur when one thread does a \"check-then-act\" (e.g. \"check\" if the value is X, then \"act\" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the \"check\" and the \"act\". E.g:\n\nif (x == 5) // The \"Check\"\n{\n   y = x * 2; // The \"Act\"\n\n   // If another thread changed x in between \"if (x == 5)\" and \"y = x * 2\" above,\n   // y will not be equal to 10.\n}\n\nThe point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.\nAlternatively, you can create a race condition (or deadlock) by giving the threads access to shared memory (e.g. global variables or structs). Write a program that breaks itself! That will serve as an excellent motivation for the next session: handing over the headaches of multi threading to ROOT. \n Hint ...Below a program that creates a race condition\n SolutionClick to expand#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n#include \n\nusing namespace std;\n\nint num1 = 0;\nint num2 = 0;\nbool raceDetected;\nunsigned int seed = 0x000fff;\nconst int NUM_THREADS = 2;\npthread_mutex_t mutex;\n\nvoid * thread_routine (void *thread) {\n\n    int *id_ptr, thread_num;\n\n       id_ptr = (int *) thread;\n       thread_num = *id_ptr;\n\n    int counter = 0;\n    int tmp1;\n    int tmp2;\n    int r;\n\n    do {\n        tmp1 = num1;\n          tmp2 = num2;\n        r = rand_r ( &seed ) % 11;\n          num1 = tmp1 + r;\n          num2 = tmp2 - r;\n          counter++;\n        } while ( num1 + num2 == 0 && !raceDetected );\n    raceDetected = true;\n\n    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);\n    cout \nIf you run it, printouts to screen are given when a race condition is detected.

However, ROOT6 provides us with many ways to easily access implicit parallellism, which makes our lives much easier than defining POSIX-like threads by hand.\nImplicit multi threading\nThe easiest way to learn about ROOT's implicit multi threading, is to look at an example. Say we want to read some information from a tree. This is a process that can very easily be multi threaded: operations on branches (like I/O, decompression, etc) are independent and can be carried out concurrently. \nTo tell ROOT6 to operate on our tree in a multithreaded way, all we have to do is enable implicit multithreading:\n   // First enable implicit multi-threading globally, so that the implicit parallelisation is on.\n   // The parameter of the call specifies the number of threads to use.\n   int nthreads = 4;\n   ROOT::EnableImplicitMT(nthreads);\n   // Open the file containing the tree\n   auto file = TFile::Open(\"http://root.cern.ch/files/h1/dstarmb.root\");\n   // Get the tree\n   TTree *tree = nullptr;\n   file->GetObject(\"h42\", tree);\n   const auto nEntries = tree->GetEntries();\n   // Read the branches in parallel.\n   // Note that the interface does not change, the parallelisation is internal\n   for (auto i : ROOT::TSeqUL(nEntries)) {\n      tree->GetEntry(i); // parallel read\n   }\n   // IMT parallelisation can be disabled for a specific tree\n   tree->SetImplicitMT(false);\n   // If now GetEntry is invoked on the tree, the reading is sequential\n   for (auto i : ROOT::TSeqUL(nEntries)) {\n      tree->GetEntry(i); // sequential read\n   }\n   // Parallel reading can be re-enabled\n   tree->SetImplicitMT(true);\n   // IMT can be also disabled globally.\n   // As a result, no tree will run GetEntry in parallel\n   ROOT::DisableImplicitMT();\n   // This is still sequential: the global flag is disabled, even if the\n   // flag for this particular tree is enabled\n   for (auto i : ROOT::TSeqUL(nEntries)) {\n      tree->GetEntry(i); // sequential read\n   }\n\n ExerciseRun the above example using a single-threaded or multi threaded approach. Time how quickly the tree is read (use e.g. the TStopWatch class), using different numbers of threads. \n\nTProcessExecutor\nOur first example was very easy - we did not have to do anything except for telling ROOT to enable multi threading. However, we have fancier tools to use, namely the TProcessExecutor. \nThe TProcessExecutor uses multi processing (as the name implies). It provides a simple interface to execute the same task multiple times in parallel, possibly with different arguments every time (this mimics the behaviour of python's pool.Map method). \nThis class inherits its interfaces from ROOT::TExecutor.  The two possible usages of the Map method are:\n\nMap(F func, unsigned nTimes): func is executed nTimes with no arguments\nMap(F func, T& args): func is executed on each element of the collection of arguments args\n\nFor either signature, func is executed as many times as needed by a pool of fNWorkers workers; the number of workers can be passed to the constructor or set via SetNWorkers. It defaults to the number of cores. A collection containing the result of each execution is returned.\n BewareNote: the user is responsible for the deletion of any object that might be created upon execution of func, returned objects included: ROOT::TProcessExecutor never deletes what it returns, it simply forgets it.\nNote: that the usage of ROOT::TProcessExecutor::Map is indicated only when the task to be executed takes more than a few seconds, otherwise the overhead introduced by Map will outrun the benefits of parallel execution on most machines.\n\nLet's take a closer look at how we can construct our processes. What we need are the following parameters\n\nfunc    a lambda expression, an std::function, a loaded macro, a functor class or a function that takes zero arguments (for the first signature) or one (for the second signature).\nargs    a standard vector, a ROOT::TSeq of integer type or an initializer list for the second signature. \n\nFor example, using a lambda expression and an initializer list for the ROOT::TSeq, our process executor could look like\nROOT::TProcessExecutor pool(2); auto squares = pool.Map([](int a) { return a*a; }, {1,2,3});\n\nThis looks more complicated than it is. Let's look at an example in the wild, where we fill four histograms with random numbers simultaneously:\n// Total amount of numbers\nconst UInt_t nNumbers = 20000000U;\n// The number of workers\nconst UInt_t nWorkers = 4U;\n\n   // We define our work item\n   auto workItem = [](UInt_t workerID) {\n      // One generator, file and ntuple per worker\n      TRandom3 workerRndm(workerID); // Change the seed\n      TFile f(Form(\"myFile_%u.root\", workerID), \"RECREATE\");\n      TH1F h(Form(\"myHisto_%u\", workerID), \"The Histogram\", 64, -4, 4);\n      for (UInt_t i = 0; i \n ExerciseFirst, run the example that is shown above. Then, think of a macro that you have somewhere on your laptop, and see if you can multi process it. \n\nTTreeProcessorMT\nA lot of the work that we do, involves manipulation trees. The TTreeProcessorMT method provides an implicit parallelisation of the reading and processing of a TTree. In particular, when invoking Process, the user provides a function that iterates on a subrange of the tree via a TTreeReader. Multiple tasks will be spawned, one for each sub-range, so that the processing of the tree is parallelised.\nSince two invocations of the user function can potentially run in parallel, the function code must be thread safe (remember the discussion on race conditions and deadlocks). For this, we can use, ROOT::TThreadedObject, which makes objects thread private. With the help of this class, histograms can be filled safely inside the user function and then merged at the end to get the final result.\nBy means of its Process method, ROOT::TTreeProcessorMT provides a way to process the entries of a TTree in parallel. When invoking TTreeProcessor::Process, the user passes a function whose only parameter is a TTreeReader. The function iterates on a subrange of entries by using that TTreeReader.\nThe implementation of ROOT::TTreeProcessorMT parallelizes the processing of the subranges, each corresponding to a cluster in the TTree. This is possible thanks to the use of a ROOT::TThreadedObject, so that each thread works with its own TFile and TTree objects. \nYet again, let's give it a whirl!\n   // First enable implicit multi-threading globally, so that the implicit parallelisation is on.\n   // The parameter of the call specifies the number of threads to use.\n   int nthreads = 4;\n   ROOT::EnableImplicitMT(nthreads);\n   // Create one TThreadedObject per histogram to fill during the processing of the tree\n   ROOT::TThreadedObject ptHist(\"pt_dist\", \"p_{T} Distribution;p_{T};dN/p_{T}dp_{T}\", 100, 0, 5);\n   ROOT::TThreadedObject pzHist(\"pz_dist\", \"p_{Z} Distribution;p_{Z};dN/dp_{Z}\", 100, 0, 5);\n   ROOT::TThreadedObject pxpyHist(\"px_py\", \"p_{X} vs p_{Y} Distribution;p_{X};p_{Y}\", 100, -5., 5., 100, -5., 5.);\n   // Create a TTreeProcessorMT: specify the file and the tree in it\n   ROOT::TTreeProcessorMT tp(\"http://root.cern.ch/files/tp_process_imt.root\", \"events\");\n   // Define the function that will process a subrange of the tree.\n   // The function must receive only one parameter, a TTreeReader,\n   // and it must be thread safe. To enforce the latter requirement,\n   // TThreadedObject histograms will be used.\n   auto myFunction = [&](TTreeReader &myReader) {\n      TTreeReaderValue> tracksRV(myReader, \"tracks\");\n      // For performance reasons, a copy of the pointer associated to this thread on the\n      // stack is used\n      auto myPtHist = ptHist.Get();\n      auto myPzHist = pzHist.Get();\n      auto myPxPyHist = pxpyHist.Get();\n      while (myReader.Next()) {\n         auto tracks = *tracksRV;\n         for (auto &&track : tracks) {\n            myPtHist->Fill(track.Pt(), 1. / track.Pt());\n            myPxPyHist->Fill(track.Px(), track.Py());\n            myPzHist->Fill(track.Pz());\n         }\n      }\n   };\n   // Launch the parallel processing of the tree\n   tp.Process(myFunction);\n   // Use the TThreadedObject::Merge method to merge the thread private histograms\n   // into the final result\n   auto ptHistMerged = ptHist.Merge();\n   auto pzHistMerged = pzHist.Merge();\n   auto pxpyHistMerged = pxpyHist.Merge();\n\n ExerciseThe exercise here is the same as before: run the code snippet above, and play with the number of threads. You can of course plot the histograms by simply doing\nptHistMerged->DrawCopy()\n\nMulti core reading of TChain data\nIf time permits, let's look at a few more things. Below, it is illustrated how we can use a TTreeProcessorMP (so a multi processed version of the TTreeReader to delegate reading of TChain data to multiple cores\n   // No nuisance for batch execution\n   gROOT->SetBatch();\n   //---------------------------------------\n   // Perform the operation sequentially\n   TChain inputChain(\"multiCore\");\n   inputChain.Add(\"mp101_multiCore_*.root\");\n   if (inputChain.GetNtrees() > outHisto\");\n   outHisto.Fit(\"gaus\");\n   //---------------------------------------\n   // We now go MP!\n   // TProcessExecutor offers an interface to directly process trees and chains without\n   // the need for the user to go through the low level implementation of a\n   // map-reduce.\n   // We adapt our parallelisation to the number of input files\n   const auto nFiles = inputChain.GetListOfFiles()->GetEntries();\n   // This is the function invoked during the processing of the trees.\n   auto workItem = [](TTreeReader &reader) {\n      TTreeReaderValue randomRV(reader, \"r\");\n      auto partialHisto = new TH1F(\"outHistoMP\", \"Random Numbers\", 128, -4, 4);\n      while (reader.Next()) {\n         partialHisto->Fill(*randomRV);\n      }\n      return partialHisto;\n   };\n   // Create the pool of processes\n   ROOT::TTreeProcessorMP workers(nFiles);\n   // Process the TChain\n   auto sumHistogram = workers.Process(inputChain, workItem, \"multiCore\");\n   sumHistogram->Fit(\"gaus\", 0);\n\n ExerciseRun the above code snippet. Note, that it needs some input! This can be generated by the mp101_fillNtuples.C macro, which is given below. \n generate your trees...Click to expand// Total amount of numbers\nconst UInt_t nNumbers = 20000000U;\n\n// The number of workers\nconst UInt_t nWorkers = 4U;\n\n// We split the work in equal parts\nconst auto workSize = nNumbers / nWorkers;\n\n// A simple function to fill ntuples randomly\nvoid fillRandom(TNtuple &ntuple, TRandom3 &rndm, UInt_t n)\n{\n   for (auto i : ROOT::TSeqI(n))\n      ntuple.Fill(rndm.Gaus());\n}\n\nInt_t mp101_fillNtuples()\n{\n\n   // No nuisance for batch execution\n   gROOT->SetBatch();\n\n   //---------------------------------------\n   // Perform the operation sequentially\n\n   // Create a random generator and and Ntuple to hold the numbers\n   TRandom3 rndm(1);\n   TFile ofile(\"mp101_singleCore.root\", \"RECREATE\");\n   TNtuple randomNumbers(\"singleCore\", \"Random Numbers\", \"r\");\n   fillRandom(randomNumbers, rndm, nNumbers);\n   randomNumbers.Write();\n   ofile.Close();\n\n   //---------------------------------------\n   // We now go MP!\n\n   // We define our work item\n   auto workItem = [](UInt_t workerID) {\n      // One generator, file and ntuple per worker\n      TRandom3 workerRndm(workerID); // Change the seed\n      TFile ofile(Form(\"mp101_multiCore_%u.root\", workerID), \"RECREATE\");\n      TNtuple workerRandomNumbers(\"multiCore\", \"Random Numbers\", \"r\");\n      fillRandom(workerRandomNumbers, workerRndm, workSize);\n      workerRandomNumbers.Write();\n      return 0;\n   };\n\n   // Create the pool of workers\n   ROOT::TProcessExecutor workers(nWorkers);\n\n   // Fill the pool with work\n   workers.Map(workItem, ROOT::TSeqI(nWorkers));\n\n   return 0;\n}\n\n\nTTaskGroup\nThe last item that we will illustrate, is the TTaskGroup. TTask is a base class that can be used to build a complex tree of Tasks. Each TTask derived class may contain other TTasks that can be executed recursively, such that a complex program can be dynamically built and executed by invoking the services of the top level Task or one of its subtasks. If you do analysis in ALICE, you surely know TTasks, since they form the base class of AliAnalysisTaskSE. \nTTaskGroup provides a way to manage the asynchronous execution of work items. A TTaskGroup represents concurrent execution of a group of tasks. Tasks may be dynamically added to the group as it is executing. \nBelow an example of usage of the TTaskGroup for calculating Fibonacci series. See if you can run. And who knows, maybe in a few years, your analysis will benefit from paralellism as well ...\nint Fibonacci(int n)\n{\n   if (n \nYou will have to store the above example in a macro, let's call it fib.C, and load it in a ROOT session to execute it:\nroot .L fib.C \nroot [1] mt302_TTaskGroupNested()\nFibonacci(33) = 3524578\n ROOT::ExperimentalYou might notice, that in the code snippet above, we use items from the ROOT::Experimental namespace. As the name implies, these are experimental features. Depending on your ROOT6 version, these features might have been moved from the Experimental namespace to a general namespace, in which case, the T that starts the class name, might have been changed into an R to avoid namespace clashes. \n\nEnabling thread safety\nIn the previous section, we have talked quite a bit about race conditions and thread safety. How are these taken care of in the ROOT landscape? \nROOT provides a global mutex to make ROOT thread safe/aware. By enabling it, the following processes are ensured to be safe\n\nconcurrent construction and destruction of TObjects, including the ones registered in ROOT's global lists (e.g. gROOT->GetListOfCleanups(), gROOT->GetListOfFiles())\nconcurrent usage of different ROOT objects from different threads, including ones with global state (e.g. TFile, TTree, TChain) with the exception of graphics classes (e.g. TCanvas)\nconcurrent calls to ROOT's type system classes, e.g. TClass and TEnum\nconcurrent calls to the interpreter through gInterpreter\nconcurrent loading of ROOT plug-ins\n\nIn addition, gDirectory, gFile and gPad become a thread-local variable. In all threads, gDirectory defaults to gROOT, a singleton which supports thread-safe insertion and deletion of contents. gFile and gPad default to nullptr, as it is for single-thread programs.\nNote that there is no DisableThreadSafety(). ROOT's thread-safety features cannot be disabled once activated. \nBelow is an example of parallell execution in ROOT, guaranteeing thread safety:\nconst UInt_t poolSize = 4U;\nInt_t mtbb201_parallelHistoFill()\n{\n   ROOT::EnableThreadSafety();\n   TH1::AddDirectory(false);\n   ROOT::TThreadExecutor pool(poolSize);\n   auto fillRandomHisto = [](int seed = 0) {\n      TRandom3 rndm(seed);\n      auto h = new TH1F(\"myHist\", \"Filled in parallel\", 128, -8, 8);\n      for (auto i : ROOT::TSeqI(1000000)) {\n         h->Fill(rndm.Gaus(0, 1));\n      }\n      return h;\n   };\n   auto seeds = ROOT::TSeqI(23);\n   ROOT::ExecutorUtils::ReduceObjects redfunc;\n   auto sumRandomHisto = pool.MapReduce(fillRandomHisto, seeds, redfunc);\n   auto c = new TCanvas();\n   sumRandomHisto->Draw();\n   return 0;\n}\n\n General exercisesAs already mentioned in the text, exercises here comprise running the examples, and looking for good candidates in your own macros that you could re-write in a multi threaded or multi processed way. \nIt is always good to test whether or not multi threading / processing actually helps: both come with overhead, and depending on the task at hand, can either speed up execution or your program, slow it down, or do nothing at all. \n\n"},"analysis/changes.html":{"url":"analysis/changes.html","title":"Part 5 - 5 to 6: changes to user code","keywords":"","body":"Transition from ROOT5 to ROOT6\nROOT6 is similar to ROOT5\n\nIt comes with the same library of classes (base\nclasses, histogram classes like TH1, ...) which share the same interface as under\nROOT5\nIt provides a command line interface as ROOT5, and runs macros just\nlike under ROOT5\n\nThere are however some differences between ROOT5 and ROOT6, which will be discussed in this section. \n ROOT6 and AliROOTAliPhysics can be\nbuilt against ROOT6 in the following way:\naliBuild -z --defaults root6 build AliPhysics\n\nFor classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics this transition is transparent. For code in\nmacros there are however a few difference. This page tries to summarize the\ndifferences in behaviour observed so far and gives some suggestions how to solve\nthese issues so work can go on smoothly under ROOT6.\n\nCLING: ROOT's just-in-time compiler\nFor the command line interface and running macros ROOT5 uses CINT, which is an\ninterpreter for C/C++. \n\nAn interpreter processes a macro line-by-line\nIt depends on the implementation of the interpreter how C++ code will be handled and how\nclose the interpretation comes to the language standard\n\n C++ ...?ROOT5 allows for some\ndeviations from the language standards, which means that some coding errors\nwhich would thrown by a compiler leading in a break of the compilation are still\ntolerated by ROOT5. Furthermore the standard library is not fully supported as\nits handling has to be implemented into the compiler. \n\nMacros can however also be\nrun in the compiled mode by ROOT5 (adding a \"+\" to the macro name). In this case\n\nROOT calls an external compiler to compile the macro to a library which is loaded\ninto ROOT\nOnce the macro runs in compiled mode it is expected to be fully\ncompatible with the C++ standard and coding error free as the compiler will not\ntolerate compiler errors.\n\nIn contrast to this ROOT6 uses a just-in-time compiler called cling. A\njust-in-time compiler translates each statement, no matter whether it is a single\ncommand or a complicated macro, into machine code as it would be a program and\nonly afterwards runs this piece of code. In order to translate code into machine\ncode the compiler must know how to translate every single line. Based on powerful\ncompiler library this means for ROOT6 that all macro must comply to 100% with\nthe C++ language standard, and exceptions will not be tolerated. Furthermore this\nalso means that all symbols and objects must be known at compile time. This has\nthree side effects:\n\nLoading Functions with gROOT->LoadMacro(...);: This function loads all\nfunctions it finds within the macro into ROOT during run time. For an interpreter\nthis is sufficient as the functions are used after they are loaded. However the\ncompiler must know all symbols used in a macro at compile time.\nLoading libraries with gSystem->Load(...);: Here we have the same problem:\nThe symbols in the libraries must be known before they are used.\nCompiling ALICE analysis tasks on the fly with gROOT->LoadMacro(\"...+\");:\nAs the analysis task compiled like this will be converted in a library it must be\nknow to the just-in-time compiler before.\n\nFor all three cases exist workarounds which will be discussed in the next\nsections. In general macros which were running under ROOT5 in the compiled mode\nwill also run under ROOT6. Macros which were running only in the interpreted\nmode might contain coding errors which were not handled by ROOT5 and might\ntherefore need fixes. However the just-in-time compiler will give precise error\nmessages leading exactly to the lines which need fixes.\nHow can I call macros inside macros?\nCalling macros inside macros is a bit tricky as the result of a macro will be\navailable only at runtime. There are however several workarounds which cover the \nmost common use cases:\n\nUsing ROOT's TMacro:\nTMacro is a wrapper class around the macro processing. It is constructed with\nthe macro path. The macro is run using TMacro::Exec. The result of\nTMacro::Exec() is a number representing an address in memory where to\nfind the resulting object. This has to be cast into a pointer to an object of\nthe expected type. Example:\n\n\n  TMacro physseladd(gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"));\n  AliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(physseladd.Exec());\n\n  The macro is still evaluated at runtime, however with the reinterpret_cast to\n  AliPhysicsSelectionTask * we tell ROOT that the result of the macro\n  interpretation must be of type AliPhysicsSelectionTask *, so the type is known\n  at compile time. TMacro::Exec optionally gets a string representation of the\n  function arguments. This might be a bit complicated to handle, particularly if\n  the arguments are dynamic and change at run time. The method works both for\n  ROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nUsing gROOT/gInterpreter->ProcessLine: \nMacro execution can be launched as well via gROOT->ProcessLine() /\ngInterpreter->ProcessLine(). As with TMacro this method is focused on running\na macro and not loading content from it. The ProcessLine method returns a\nlong number representing an address in memory where to find the output objects.\nThis number has to be cast to the expected output type using a\nreinterpret_cast in order to access the content of the output objects. The\nfollowing example runs the add macro for the physics selection task:\n\n\n  AliPhysicsSelectionTask *physseltask = reinterpret_cast(gInterpreter->ProcessLine(Form(\".x %s\", gSystem->ExpandPathName(\"$ALICE_PHYSICS/OADB/macros/AddTaskPhysicsSelection.C\"))))\n\n  Adding function arguments is possible here as well as a simple string\n  representation after the macro path, surrounded with (). This method also works\n  both under ROOT5 and ROOT6.\n\nIncluding macros:\nAs ROOT6 compiles the macro it is possible to include macros and treat them\nas if they were header files. In order for this to work it is essential to tell\nROOT before where to find the macro. This can be done using the preprocessor\nmacro R_ADD_INCLUDE_PATH(...). For the just-in-time compiler macros\nincluded will look as if they were part of the code itself. The following macro\nruns under ROOT6:\n\n\n  #ifdef __CLING__\n  // Tell  ROOT where to find AliRoot headers\n  R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_ROOT)\n  #include \n\n  // Tell ROOT where to find AliPhysics headers\n  R__ADD_INCLUDE_PATH($ALICE_PHYSICS)\n  #include \n  #endif\n\n  void simpleaddtest(){\n    AliAnalysisManager *mgr = new AliAnalysisManager;\n\n    // Take function from macro AddESDHandler\n    // no gROOT->LoadMacro for ROOT6\n    AddESDHandler();\n\n    AliPhysicsSelectionTask *test = AddTaskPhysicsSelection(kTRUE);\n\n    mgr->InitAnalysis();\n    mgr->PrintStatus();\n  }\n\n  In particular when passing arguments to the macro (in the example above passing\n  kTRUE to AddTaskPhysicsSelection) this method is very convenient. This method\n  is specific to ROOT6. The part including macros has to be protected (see\n  below).\n NEW: C++ string literalsIn C++, to escape characters like “\\n” we use an extra “\\”. From C++ 11, we can use raw strings in which escape characters (like \\n \\t or \\” ) are not processed. The syntax of raw string is that the literal starts with R”( and ends in )”.\nLet’s see an an example to see raw string literal in C++:\n\n// C++ program to demonstrate working of raw string. \n#include  \nusing namespace std; \n\nint main() \n{ \n    // A Normal string \n    string string1 = \"Geeks.\\nFor.\\nGeeks.\\n\" ;  \n\n    // A Raw string \n    string string2 = R\"(Geeks.\\nFor.\\nGeeks.\\n)\";  \n\n    cout \nthis code will ouptut\nGeeks.\nFor.\nGeeks.\n\nGeeks.\\nFor.\\nGeeks.\\n\nThis can come in handy when dealing with calling macros within macros, consider for example that you have a dummy AddTask macro that takes a boolean and and a string as arguments. The way\n  to call this function would then be\n    TString arguments = R\"((kTRUE, \"test.root\"))\";\n    AliAnalysisTaskDummy *task = reinterpret_cast(gInterpreter->ProcessLine(\".x AddTaskDummy.C\" +  arguments));\n\n  Note the syntax! The outer R\"( and )\" are part of the TString literal while the innner ( and ) \n  are there for the function call of AddTaskDummmy.\n\nWhat about loading libraries that are not automatically loaded?\nROOT can load libraries automatically via so-called rootmaps, but if you compile your own class, on which you are developing, in a steering macro, this class is not known to ROOT and therefore cannot be auto loaded. This can be cumbersome. However, you can load your compiled classes within a macro by hand. \nIn a ROOT session, do\n    .L myDummyClass.cpp++g\n\n  This will generate a shared object file (.so). Now, in a given macro in which you want to access your class, write in the preamble\n    R__LOAD_LIBRARY(myDummyClass.so)\n\nwhich will load the shared library, and give you access to all the symbols defined within. Note the syntax: despite what you might expect, the word myDummyClass should not be put within quotes \"\"!\nDo I need to include header files in my macros?\nROOT6 comes with a technique called pre-compiled header files. Header files\nfrom a certain library are compiled to a binary format by rootcling, the\nsuccessor of rootcint, and loaded into ROOT6 by an auto-loading mechanism\nsimilar to the rootmap mechanism. \nOnce rootcling is invoked with the\nargument -rml name a .pcm-file is created containing the pre-compiled\nheaders. ROOT6 will search for .pcm-files in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\nFor libraries providing .pcm-support NO headers should be included in macros.\nFor libraries handled by the user make sure to\n\nrun rootcling with the arguments -rmf for the .rootmap file\nand -rml for the .pcm file\nInstall both the .rootmap and the .pcm file of your library path in the \nlibrary location (usually PROJECT_PATH/lib)\n\nOnce you have done this, there is no need anymore to e.g. call R_LOAD_LIBRARY(myDummyClass.so) when you want to access symbols defined in myDummyClass; rather than that, the corresponding library will be automatically loaded by ROOT once a symbol defined in it is encountered. \nTroubleshooting: I get a huge amount of errors, and my macro doesn't run. What can I do?\nHere are few examples that commonly appear in user macros and which are tolerated by ROOT5 but not anymore by ROOT6:\n\nUndefined symbols:\nMaybe you have something like this in your code:\ntaskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThe variable taskname was not defined before. It was implicitly defined in ROOT5 as const char *. In ROOT6 this leads to the error\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'taskname'\nThe variable taskname must be defined with a type before a value can be assigned. In this case the proper code would be\nconst char *taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThanks to C++11 ROOT6 can also detect the type implicitly using the keyword\nauto. In this case the code looks the following:\nauto taskname = \"mytask\";\n\nThis will however not be transparent to ROOT5 as ROOT5 doesn't understand\nC++11.\nNote: On the command line ROOT6 automatically adds the auto keyword. The \nstatement above will be possible in the interpreted mode of ROOT6.\n\nMissing forward declarations\nConsider this macro:\nvoid fail_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\nUnder ROOT5 this macro will run, but under ROOT6 it will raise the following compiler error:\nerror: use of undeclared identifier 'test'\nThe function test is defined, but after it is used. In ROOT5 this is\nno problem: During interpretation the interpreter loads all functions. But\nunder ROOT6 the macro is compiled, and now the order matters: Functions need\nto be declared before they are used. Adding a forward declaration is \nsufficient in order to make the macro working. The following version of\nthe macro will run also under ROOT6:\nint test(int a, int b);\n\nvoid run_forward() {\n  int result = test(2,4);\n  printf(\"2 + 4 = %d\\n\", result);\n}\n\nint test(int a, int b) {\n  return a + b;\n}\n\n\nHandling of pointer and objects:\nROOT5 does not enforce using the proper access operator for objects, pointers and\nreferences, but will allow the usage of the operator -> for\nreferences and the operator . for pointers. ROOT6 distinguishes\nbetween them, and consequently the proper access operator needs to be used.\nConsider the following macro:\nvoid fail_access(){\n  TH1F *ptr = new TH1F(\"ptr\", \"ptr\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  ptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n\n  TH1F obj(\"obj\", \"obj\", 1, 0., 1.);\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj.GetTitle());\n}\n\nConsequently the wrong access operator is used. ROOT5 will warn about the\nincorrect access operator, but it will run the macro. Trying this under ROOT6\nends in the following errors:\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\nptr.SetTitle(\"test1\");\n  ~~~^\n     ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F *' is a pointer; did you mean to use '->'?\n  printf(\"Title 1: %s\\n\", ptr.GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^\n                             ->\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  obj->SetTitle(\"test2\");\n  ~~~^~\n     .\n...: error: member reference type 'TH1F' is not a pointer; did you mean to use '.'?\n  printf(\"Title 2: %s\\n\", obj->GetTitle());\n                          ~~~^~\n                             .\n\n\n I get a huge amount of unknown symbols from classes in AliRoot or AliPhysics? Do I still need to include header files?In case the compilation of a macro under ROOT6 fails libraries and pre-compiled\nheaders from external packages are not loaded. The consequence is that ROOT6\ndoes not know about these classes and will raise errors about unknown symbols.\nOnce all the initial compiler errors are fixed (usually at the very top of\nthe error log), the next time the macros are compiled ROOT6 will also load the\nlibraries and .pch files from external libraries and the errors disappear. Header\nfrom ALICE libraries should NOT be included.\n\nHow do I distinguish between ROOT5 and ROOT6 in my macros?\nSometimes macros require different treatment for ROOT5 and ROOT6. It is then\nnecessary to know which ROOT version is used while the macro is running.\nROOT5 defines the preprocessor macro __CINT__, which can be used to check\nwhether one is in an interpreter session. In current (up to at least v6-12-04)\nhowever also ROOT6 exports __CINT__, so this macro cannot be used to\ndistinguish between ROOT versions.\nROOT6 in addition __CLING__ which is not present in ROOT5. The following lines \nindicate how to run ROOT5/ROOT6 specific code:\n#if defined(__CLING__)\n  // ROOT6-specific code here ...\n#elif defined(__CINT__)\n  // ROOT5-specific code here ...\n#endif\n\nI heard TF1 has changed fundamentally. Is there something to be aware of?\nTF1 is based on TFormula for the formula representation. TFormula got a heavy\nchange: In ROOT5 formulas were always interpreted on-the-fly. With ROOT6 they\nare compiled by the just-in-time compiler. While this leads to a significant\nspeedup in particular when the formula is evaluated multiple times (in fit\nprocedures for example) it comes on cost of breaking backward compatibility, for\nwhich reading TFormula/TF1 object created with ROOT6 with ROOT5 will lead to\nerrors. For what concerns TFormala a ROOT5-compatible version has been added to\nROOT6 as ROOT::v5::TFormula, however something similar does not exist for\nTF1. In order to read a TF1 object from a ROOT file under ROOT5 it has to be\ncreated under ROOT5.\nNow my macro finally works under ROOT6. Will it still work under ROOT5?\nIt depends whether the macro now contains something which ROOT5 does NOT\nunderstand.\n\nROOT6 is fully compatible with C++11. In ROOT5 C++11 support is not\nimplemented, but the standard C++98 is used. C++11-specific code will not\nbe understood.\nAll NEW features provided by ROOT6 are of course not ported to ROOT5.\nThis in particular affects:\nTTreeReader\nTProcPool\nTDataFrame\n...\n\n\nStandard library support in ROOT5, while it comes out-if-the-box in ROOT6.\nIf the macro should run under both ROOT versions consider ROOT containers\ninstead.\nIf your classes write stl-containers containing ROOT-objects to a ROOT-file \nthey must be declared to ROOT5 in your LinkDef.h file. Example:#pragma link C++ class std::vector+;\n\nFor ROOT6 this is not necessary.\n\n\n\nExercise\nThe exercise here is to find some old macros you have, that worked under ROOT5 - and see how 'C++ compliant' they actually are, but loading them in a ROOT6 session. \n"},"analysis/vectorization.html":{"url":"analysis/vectorization.html","title":"Part 6 - Vectorization","keywords":"","body":"Vectorization\nVectorization is a topic that we will cover only very briefly, mostly to make you aware of its existence. Before we head into details, let's take a look at this picture\n\nThis picture summarizes what is known as 'Flynn's taxonomy', which is a classification of computer architectures in terms of data pools and instruction pools, based on the number of concurrent instruction streams and data streams. In the picture above, we see\n\nSISD: single instruction stream single data stream\nSIMD: single instruction stream, multiple data streams\nMISD: multiple instruction streams, single data stream\nMIMD: multiple instruction streams, multiple data streams (basically a distributed system)\n\n  MISD? The MISD architecture might seem very strange, but is used in application where fault tolerance is extremely important, such as the flight control computer of the Space Shuttle program. \n\nVectorization relies on the properties of SIMD: single instruction stream, multiple data streams. \nWhat is vectorization?\nVectorization is a special case of automatic parallelization, where a computer program is converted from a\n\nscalar implementation, which processes a single pair of operands at a time, to a \nvector implementation, which processes one operation on multiple pairs of operands at once. \n\nConventional computers typically have vector operations that simultaneously perform operations via SIMD or SPMD hardware. How does this work? Say we want to multiply two vectors of numeric data. A scalar approach would be something like: \n for (i = 0; i \nThe loop is executed 1024 times. Not only that, but for each iteration, and new and independent data pool and instruction pool are required. \nThis could be vectorized to look something like: \n  for (i = 0; i \nHere, C[i:i+3] represents the four array elements from C[i] to C[i+3] and the vector processor can perform four operations for a single vector instruction. The loop is only evaluated 256 times, and since the four vector operations complete in roughly the same time as one scalar instruction (for each iteration, one data pool and one instruction pool are required), the vector approach can run up to four times faster than the original code.\nHow is this helpful ?\nVectorization uses data level parallelism but not concurrency: \n\nthere are simultaneous (parallel) computations, but \nonly a single process (instruction) at a given moment. \n\nSIMD is particularly applicable to common tasks such as adjusting the contrast in a digital image or adjusting the volume of digital audio. Most modern CPU designs include SIMD instructions to improve the performance of multimedia use. \nVectorization can be very useful, but for very specific problems, e.g. when\n\nThe same value is being added to (or subtracted from) a large number of data points. This is an often used application of SIMD: for example when changing the brightness of an image where each pixel of an image consists of three values for the brightness of the red (R), green (G) and blue (B) portions of the color and a common value is added to (or subtracted from) them\n\n Why not vectorize the world .. ? Not all algorithms can be vectorized easily! Additionally, vectorization is labor-intensive: implementing an algorithm with SIMD instructions usually requires human intervention as most compilers do not generate SIMD instructions from a typical C/C++/etc program. \nAutomatic vectorization in compilers is an active area of computer science research, as e.g. modern graphics processing units (GPUs) are often wide SIMD implementations, capable of branches, loads, and stores on 128 or 256 bits at a time. \n\nVectorization support in ROOT\nWe would not talk about vectorization if it would not have a direct connection to ROOT. Also in physics, some problems might benefit from vectorization. Therefore, ROOT has introduced built-in vector types: Float_v and Double_v, which look like normal types (float and double), but the suffix _v tells us that they are vector types. \nVectorization support in ROOT comprises the following:\n\nIntegration of VecCore in ROOT as the common vector abstraction in HEP\nDefinition of new ROOT SIMD types: ROOT::Double_v, ROOT::Float_v.\n\n\nAdaptation of TF1 to evaluate functions evaluating over vector types.\nAdaptation of the fitting classes and interfaces in ROOT to accept the new\nSIMD types and functions implementing them.\nParallelization of the fitting objective functions (Max. Likelihood, Least\nSquares)\n\nTFormula supports vectorization. All the TF1 objected created with a formula expression can have a vectorized signature using ROOT::Double_v: TF1::EvalPar( ROOT::Double_v  x, double  p). The vectorization can then be used to speed-up fitting. It is not enabled by default, but it can be enabled by callig TF1::SetVectorized(true) or using the \"VEC\" option in the constructor of TF1, when ROOT has been built with VecCore and one vectorization library such as Vc.\n//Higgs Fit: Implementation of the scalar function\ndouble func(const double *data, const double *params) {\n   return params[0] * exp(-(*data + (-130.)) * (*data + (-130.)) / 2) +\n       params[1] * exp(-(params[2] * (*data * (0.01)) - params[3] *\n       ((*data) * (0.01)) * ((*data) * (0.01))));\n}\n\nTF1 *f = new TF1(”fScalar”, func, 100, 200, 4);\nf->SetParameters(1, 1000, 7.5, 1.5);\nTH1D h1f(”h1f”, ”Test random numbers”, 12800, 100, 200);\nh1f.FillRandom(”fvScalar”, 1000000);\nh1f.Fit(f);\n\nin the vectorized approach, we change the built-in types\n//Higgs Fit: Implementation of the vectorized function\nROOT::Double_v func(const ROOT::Double_v *data, const double *params) {\n    return params[0] * exp(-(*data + (-130.)) * (*data + (-130.)) / 2) +\n       params[1] * exp(-(params[2] * (*data * (0.01)) - params[3] *\n       ((*data) * (0.01)) * ((*data) * (0.01))));\n}\n\n//This code is totally backwards compatible\nTF1 *f = new TF1(”fvCore”, func, 100, 200, 4);\nf->SetParameters(1, 1000, 7.5, 1.5);\nTH1D h1f(”h1f”, ”Test random numbers”, 12800, 100, 200);\nh1f.FillRandom(”fvCore”, 1000000);\n//Added multithreaded fit option\nh1f.Fit(f, ”MULTITHREAD”);\n\nAs you see, the changes to user code are minimal. However, behind the scenes, the fitting operation exploits SIMD principles to speed up the execution of your code. \n Support for vector types in C++C++ supports vector types through e.g. Vc\n#include \nusing float_v = Vc::float_v;\n...\nfor (; i \nsee [https://github.com/VcDevel/Vc] for more information. \n\nExercises\nThis section in principle has no exercises, but you are encouraged to try run the above examples using both the scalar and vectorized implementation of the fitting routine, and see if there is indeed a speed benefit. \n"},"analysis/tdf/declarative.html":{"url":"analysis/tdf/declarative.html","title":"Part 7 - Declarative analysis","keywords":"","body":"Declarative programming\nIn this chapter we want to give a short introduction to the idea of declarative programming and its implementation in ROOT, that comes as the TDataFrame.\n"},"analysis/tdf/concept.html":{"url":"analysis/tdf/concept.html","title":"Declarative programming","keywords":"","body":"Declarative programming\nDeclarative programming tells the program what to do, where an imparative approach is to tell it how to do something.\nYou walk into a bar.\n Order ten beers for you (and you friends)You approach the barkeeper and...\n ImperativeClick to expandImperative (WHAT): ask him to to go over to the glasses, take one, go to the tap and pour a glass.

The implementation automatically puts in place several low level optimisations such as multi-thread parallelisation and caching.\nIntroduction\nA pipeline of operations is described to be performed on the data, the framework takes care of the management of the loop over entries as well as low-level details such as I/O and parallelisation. TDataFrame provides an interface to perform most common operations required by ROOT analyses; at the same time, the users are not limited to those common operations: building blocks to trigger custom calculations are available too.\nTDataFrame is built with a modular and flexible workflow in mind, summarised as follows:\n\nbuild a data-frame object by specifying your data-set\n\napply a series of transformations to your data\n\nfilter (e.g. apply some cuts) or\ncreate a temporary column (e.g. the result of an expensive computation on branches, or an alias for a branch)\n\n\napply actions to the transformed data to produce results (e.g. fill a histogram)\n\nTTreeReader\nTTreeReader reader(\"myTree\", file);\nTTreeReaderValue a(reader, \"A\");\nTTreeReaderValue b(reader, \"B\");\nTTreeReaderValue c(reader, \"C\");\nwhile(reader.Next()) {\n  if(IsGoodEvent(a, b, c))\n      DoStuff(a, b, c);\n}\n\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"myTree\", file, {\"A\", \"B\", \"C\"});\nd.Filter(IsGoodEvent).Foreach(DoStuff);\n\nTTree::Draw\nTTree *t = static_cast(\n   file->Get(\"myTree\")\n);\nt->Draw(\"var\", \"var > 2\");\n\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"myTree\", file, \"var\");\nd.Filter([](int v) { return v > 2; }).Histo1D();\n\nKeep reading to follow a five-minute crash course to TDataFrame, or jump to an overview of useful features, or a more in-depth explanation of transformations, actions and parallelism.\nCrash course\nFilling a histogram\nLet's start with a very common task: filling a histogram\n// Fill a TH1F with the \"MET\" branch\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"myTree\", filePtr); // build a TDataFrame like you would build a TTreeReader\nauto h = d.Histo1D(\"MET\");\nh->Draw();\n\nThe first line creates a TDataFrame associated to the TTree \"myTree\". This tree has a branch named \"MET\".\nHisto1D is an action; it returns a smart pointer (a TResultProxy to be precise) to a TH1F histogram filled with the MET of all events. If the quantity stored in the branch is a collection, the histogram is filled with its elements.\nThere are many other possible actions, and all their results are wrapped in smart pointers; we'll see why in a minute.\nApplying a filter\nLet's now pretend we want to cut over the value of branch \"MET\" and count how many events pass this cut:\n// Select events with \"MET\" greater than 4., count events that passed the selection\nauto metCut = [](double x) { return x > 4.; }; // a c++11 lambda function checking \"x > 4\"\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"myTree\", filePtr);\nauto c = d.Filter(metCut, {\"MET\"}).Count();\nstd::cout \nFilter takes a function (a lambda in this example, but it can be any kind of function or even a functor class) and a list of branch names. The filter function is applied to the specified branches for each event; it is required to return a bool which signals whether the event passes the filter (true) or not (false). You can think of your data as \"flowing\" through the chain of calls, being transformed, filtered and finally used to perform actions. Multiple Filter calls can be chained one after another. It is possible to specify filters as strings too. This snippet is analogous to the one above:\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"myTree\", filePtr);\nauto c = d.Filter(\"MET > 4.\").Count();\nstd::cout \nRunning on a range of entries\nIt is sometimes necessary to limit the processing of the dataset to a range of entries. For this reason, the TDataFrame offers the concept of ranges as a node of the TDataFrame graph: this means that filters, columns and actions can be hung to it. If a range is specified after a filter, the range will act exclusively on the entries surviving the filter. Here you can find some code using ranges:\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"myTree\", filePtr);\n// This is how you can express a range of the first 30 entries\nauto d_0_30 = d.Range(0, 30);\n// This is how you pick all entries from 15 onwards\nauto d_15_end = d.Range(15, 0);\n// We can use a stride too, in this case we pick an event every 3\nauto d_15_end_3 = d.Range(15, 0, 3);\nRanges are not available when multi-threading is enabled.\n\nCreating a temporary column\nLet's now consider the case in which \"myTree\" contains two quantities \"x\" and \"y\", but our analysis relies on a derived quantity z = sqrt(xx + yy). Using the Define transformation, we can create a new column in the data-set containing the variable \"z\":\nauto sqrtSum = [](double x, double y) { return sqrt(x*x + y*y); };\nauto zCut = [](double z) { return z > 0.; }\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(treeName, filePtr);\nauto zMean = d.Define(\"z\", sqrtSum, {\"x\",\"y\"})\n              .Filter(zCut, {\"z\"})\n              .Mean(\"z\");\nstd::cout \nDefine creates the variable \"z\" by applying sqrtSum to \"x\" and \"y\". Later in the chain of calls we refer to variables created with Define as if they were actual tree branches, but they are evaluated on the fly, once per event. As with filters, Define calls can be chained with other transformations to create multiple temporary columns. As with filters, it is possible to specify new columns as strings too. This snippet is analogous to the one above:\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(treeName, filePtr);\nauto zMean = d.Define(\"z\", \"sqrt(x*x + y*y)\")\n              .Filter(\"z > 0.\")\n              .Mean(\"z\");\nstd::cout \nAgain the names of the branches used in the expression and their types are inferred automatically. The string must be standard C++ and is just-in-time compiled by the ROOT interpreter, Cling.\nExecuting multiple actions\nAs a final example let us apply two different cuts on branch \"MET\" and fill two different histograms with the \"pt_v\" of the filtered events. You should be able to easily understand what's happening:\n// fill two histograms with the results of two opposite cuts\nauto isBig = [](double x) { return x > 10.; };\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(treeName, filePtr);\nauto h1 = d.Filter(isBig, {\"MET\"}).Histo1D(\"pt_v\");\nauto h2 = d.Histo1D(\"pt_v\");\nh1->Draw();       // event loop is run once here\nh2->Draw(\"SAME\"); // no need to run the event loop again\n\nTDataFrame executes all above actions by running the event-loop only once. The trick is that actions are not executed at the moment they are called, but they are lazy, i.e. delayed until the moment one of their results is accessed through the smart pointer. At that time, the even loop is triggered and all results are produced simultaneously.\nIt is therefore good practice to declare all your filters and actions before accessing their results, allowing TDataFrame to loop once and produce all results in one go.\nGoing parallel\nLet's say we would like to run the previous examples in parallel on several cores, dividing events fairly between cores. The only modification required to the snippets would be the addition of this line before constructing the main data-frame object:\nROOT::EnableImplicitMT();\n\n\nSimple as that, enjoy your speed-up. Or a crash...\nDemo on TDF and CSV\n\nExercise\nNow it's your turn. Use an existing macro you have to perfom analysis on a tree and write one that does the same but uses the TDataFrame.\nOr look for a csv file online and play around with this.\nOr use the tree maker macro by Redmer in the section on parllelism.\nHave fun!\n"},"analysis/tdf/more.html":{"url":"analysis/tdf/more.html","title":"Additional material","keywords":"","body":"Additional material to TDataFrame\nHere is a list of the most important features that have been omitted in the \"Crash course\" for brevity's sake. You don't need to read all these to start using TDataFrame, but they are useful to save typing time and runtime.\nA wide range of topics is also covered in tutorials that can be found here.\nDefault branch lists\nWhen constructing a TDataFrame object, it is possible to specify a default branch list for your analysis, in the usual form of a list of strings representing branch names. The default branch list will be used as fallback whenever one specific to the transformation/action is not present.\n// use \"b1\" and \"b2\" as default branches for 'Filter', 'Define' and actions\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d1(treeName, &file, {\"b1\",\"b2\"});\n// filter acts on default branch list, no need to specify it\nauto h = d1.Filter([](int b1, int b2) { return b1 > b2; }).Histo1D(\"otherVar\");\n// just one default branch this time\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d2(treeName, &file, {\"b1\"});\n// we can still specify non-default branch lists\n// 'Min' here can fall back to the default \"b1\"\nauto min = d2.Filter([](double b2) { return b2 > 0; }, {\"b2\"}).Min();\nBranch type guessing and explicit declaration of branch types\n\nC++ is a statically typed language: all types must be known at compile-time. This includes the types of the TTree branches we want to work on. For filters, temporary columns and some of the actions, branch types are deduced from the signature of the relevant filter function/temporary column expression/action function:\n// here b1 is deduced to be 'int' and b2 to be 'double'\ndataFrame.Filter([]\\(int x, double y) { return x > 0 && y \nIf we specify an incorrect type for one of the branches, an exception with an informative message will be thrown at runtime, when the branch value is actually read from the TTree: the implementation of TDataFrame allows the detection of type mismatches. The same would happen if we swapped the order of \"b1\" and \"b2\" in the branch list passed to Filter.\nCertain actions, on the other hand, do not take a function as argument (e.g. Histo1D), so we cannot deduce the type of the branch at compile-time. In this case TDataFrame tries to guess the type of the branch, trying out the most common ones and std::vector thereof. This is why we never needed to specify the branch types for all actions in the above snippets.\nWhen the branch type is not a common one such as int, double, char or float it is therefore good practice to specify it as a template parameter to the action itself, like this:\ndataFrame.Histo1D(\"b1\"); // OK if b1 is a \"common\" type\ndataFrame.Histo1D(\"myObject\"); // OK, \"myObject\" is deduced to be of type 'Object_t'\n// dataFrame.Histo1D(\"myObject\"); // THROWS an exception\n\nGeneric actions\nTDataFrame strives to offer a comprehensive set of standard actions that can be performed on each event. At the same time, it allows users to execute arbitrary code (i.e. a generic action) inside the event loop through the Foreach and ForeachSlot actions.\nForeach(f, branchList) takes a function f (lambda expression, free function, functor...) and a list of branches, and executes f on those branches for each event. The function passed must return nothing (i.e. void). It can be used to perform actions that are not already available in the interface. For example, the following snippet evaluates the root mean square of branch \"b\":\n// Single-thread evaluation of RMS of branch \"b\" using Foreach\ndouble sumSq = 0.;\nunsigned int n = 0;\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"bTree\", bFilePtr);\nd.Foreach(\\[&sumSq, &n](double b) { ++n; sumSq += b*b; }, {\"b\"});\nstd::cout \nWhen executing on multiple threads, users are responsible for the thread-safety of the expression passed to Foreach. The code above would need to employ some resource protection mechanism to ensure non-concurrent writing of rms; but this is probably too much head-scratch for such a simple operation.\nForeachSlot can help in this situation. It is an alternative version of Foreach for which the function takes an additional parameter besides the branches it should be applied to: an unsigned int slot parameter, where slot is a number indicating which thread (0, 1, 2 , ..., poolSize - 1) the function is being run in. We can take advantage of ForeachSlot to evaluate a thread-safe root mean square of branch \"b\":\n// Thread-safe evaluation of RMS of branch \"b\" using ForeachSlot\nROOT::EnableImplicitMT();\nunsigned int nSlots = ROOT::GetImplicitMTPoolSize();\nstd::vector sumSqs(nSlots, 0.);\nstd::vector ns(nSlots, 0);\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(\"bTree\", bFilePtr);\nd.ForeachSlot(\\[&sumSqs, &ns](unsigned int slot, double b) { sumSqs[slot] += b*b; ns[slot] += 1; }, {\"b\"});\ndouble sumSq = std::accumulate(sumSqs.begin(), sumSqs.end(), 0.); // sum all squares\nunsigned int n = std::accumulate(ns.begin(), ns.end(), 0); // sum all counts\nstd::cout \nYou see how we created one double variable for each thread in the pool, and later merged their results via std::accumulate.\nCall graphs (storing and reusing sets of transformations)\nSets of transformations can be stored as variables** and reused multiple times to create call graphs in which several paths of filtering/creation of branches are executed simultaneously; we often refer to this as \"storing the state of the chain\".\nThis feature can be used, for example, to create a temporary column once and use it in several subsequent filters or actions, or to apply a strict filter to the data-set before executing several other transformations and actions, effectively reducing the amount of events processed.\nLet's try to make this clearer with a commented example:\n// build the data-frame and specify a default branch list\nROOT::Experimental::TDataFrame d(treeName, filePtr, {\"var1\", \"var2\", \"var3\"});\n// apply a cut and save the state of the chain\nauto filtered = d.Filter(myBigCut);\n// plot branch \"var1\" at this point of the chain\nauto h1 = filtered.Histo1D(\"var1\");\n// create a new branch \"vec\" with a vector extracted from a complex object (only for filtered entries)\n// and save the state of the chain\nauto newBranchFiltered = filtered.Define(\"vec\", [](const Obj& o) { return o.getVector(); }, {\"obj\"});\n// apply a cut and fill a histogram with \"vec\"\nauto h2 = newBranchFiltered.Filter(cut1).Histo1D(\"vec\");\n// apply a different cut and fill a new histogram\nauto h3 = newBranchFiltered.Filter(cut2).Histo1D(\"vec\");\n// Inspect results\nh2->Draw(); // first access to an action result: run event-loop!\nh3->Draw(\"SAME\"); // event loop does not need to be run again here..\nstd::cout GetEntries() \nTDataFrame detects when several actions use the same filter or the same temporary column, and only evaluates each filter or temporary column once per event, regardless of how many times that result is used down the call graph. Objects read from each branch are built once and never copied, for maximum efficiency. When \"upstream\" filters are not passed, subsequent filters, temporary column expressions and actions are not evaluated, so it might be advisable to put the strictest filters first in the chain.\nTransformations\nFilters\nA filter is defined through a call to Filter(f, branchList). f can be a function, a lambda expression, a functor class, or any other callable object. It must return a bool signalling whether the event has passed the selection (true) or not (false). It must perform \"read-only\" actions on the branches, and should not have side-effects (e.g. modification of an external or static variable) to ensure correct results when implicit multi-threading is active.\nTDataFrame only evaluates filters when necessary: if multiple filters are chained one after another, they are executed in order and the first one returning false causes the event to be discarded and triggers the processing of the next entry. If multiple actions or transformations depend on the same filter, that filter is not executed multiple times for each entry: after the first access it simply serves a cached result.\nNamed filters and cutflow reports\nAn optional string parameter name can be passed to the Filter method to create a named filter. Named filters work as usual, but also keep track of how many entries they accept and reject.\nStatistics are retrieved through a call to the Report method:\nwhen Report is called on the main TDataFrame object, it prints stats for all named filters declared up to that point\nwhen called on a stored chain state (i.e. a chain/graph node), it prints stats for all named filters in the section of the chain between the main TDataFrame and that node (included).\nStats are printed in the same order as named filters have been added to the graph, and refer to the latest event-loop that has been run using the relevant TDataFrame. If Report is called before the event-loop has been run at least once, a run is triggered.\nRanges\nWhen TDataFrame is not being used in a multi-thread environment (i.e. no call to EnableImplicitMT was made), Range transformations are available. These act very much like filters but instead of basing their decision on a filter expression, they rely on start,stop and stride parameters.\n\nstart: number of entries that will be skipped before starting processing again\nstop: maximum number of entries that will be processed\nstride: only process one entry every stride entries\nThe actual number of entries processed downstream of a Range node will be (stop - start)/stride (or less if less entries than that are available).\n\nNote that ranges act \"locally\", not based on the global entry count: Range(10,50) means \"skip the first 10 entries that reach this node*, let the next 40 entries pass, then stop processing\". If a range node hangs from a filter node, and the range has a start parameter of 10, that means the range will skip the first 10 entries that pass the preceding filter.\nRanges allow \"early quitting\": if all branches of execution of a functional graph reached their stop value of processed entries, the event-loop is immediately interrupted. This is useful for debugging and initial explorations.\nTemporary columns\nTemporary columns are created by invoking Define(name, f, branchList). As usual, f can be any callable object (function, lambda expression, functor class...); it takes the values of the branches listed in branchList (a list of strings) as parameters, in the same order as they are listed in branchList. f must return the value that will be assigned to the temporary column.\nA new variable is created called name, accessible as if it was contained in the dataset from subsequent transformations/actions.\nUse cases include:\n\ncaching the results of complex calculations for easy and efficient multiple access\nextraction of quantities of interest from complex objects\nbranch aliasing, i.e. changing the name of a branch\nAn exception is thrown if the name of the new branch is already in use for another branch in the TTree.\n\nIt is also possible to specify the quantity to be stored in the new temporary column as a C++ expression with the method Define(name, expression). For example this invocation\ntdf.Define(\"pt\", \"sqrt(px*px + py*py)\");\n\nwill create a new column called \"pt\" the value of which is calculated starting from the branches px and py. The system builds a just-in-time compiled function starting from the expression after having deduced the list of necessary branches from the names of the variables specified by the user.\nActions\nInstant and lazy actions\nActions can be instant or lazy. Instant actions are executed as soon as they are called, while lazy actions are executed whenever the object they return is accessed for the first time. As a rule of thumb, actions with a return value are lazy, the others are instant.\nOverview\nHere is a quick overview of what actions are present and what they do. Each one is described in more detail in the reference guide.\nIn the following, whenever we say an action \"returns\" something, we always mean it returns a smart pointer to it. Also note that all actions are only executed for events that pass all preceding filters.\n\n\n\nLazy actions\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCount\nReturn the number of events processed.\n\n\nFill\nFill a user-defined object with the values of the specified branches, as if by calling 'Obj.Fill(branch1, branch2, ...).\n\n\nHisto{1D,2D,3D}\nFill a {one,two,three}-dimensional histogram with the processed branch values.\n\n\nMax\nReturn the maximum of processed branch values.\n\n\nMean\nReturn the mean of processed branch values.\n\n\nMin\nReturn the minimum of processed branch values.\n\n\nProfile{1D,2D}\nFill a {one,two}-dimensional profile with the branch values that passed all filters.\n\n\nReduce\nReduce (e.g. sum, merge) entries using the function (lambda, functor...) passed as argument. The function must have signature T(T,T) where T is the type of the branch. Return the final result of the reduction operation. An optional parameter allows initialization of the result object to non-default values.\n\n\nTake\nBuild a collection of values of a branch.\n\n\nInstant actions\nDescription\n\n\nForeach\nExecute a user-defined function on each entry. Users are responsible for the thread-safety of this lambda when executing with implicit multi-threading enabled.\n\n\nForeachSlot\nSame as Foreach, but the user-defined function must take an extra unsigned int slot as its first parameter. slot will take a different value, 0 to nThreads - 1, for each thread of execution. This is meant as a helper in writing thread-safe Foreach actions when using TDataFrame after ROOT::EnableImplicitMT(). ForeachSlot works just as well with single-thread execution: in that case slot will always be 0.\n\n\nSnapshot\nWrites on disk a dataset made of the selected columns and entries passing the filters (if any).\n\n\nQueries\nDescription\n\n\nReport\nThis is not properly an action, since when Report is called it does not book an operation to be performed on each entry. Instead, it interrogates the data-frame directly to print a cutflow report, i.e. statistics on how many entries have been accepted and rejected by the filters. See the section on named filters for a more detailed explanation.\n\n\n\nParallel execution\nAs pointed out before in this document, TDataFrame can transparently perform multi-threaded event loops to speed up the execution of its actions. Users only have to call ROOT::EnableImplicitMT() before constructing the TDataFrame object to indicate that it should take advantage of a pool of worker threads. Each worker thread processes a distinct subset of entries, and their partial results are merged before returning the final values to the user.\nThread safety\nFilter and Define transformations should be inherently thread-safe: they have no side-effects and are not dependent on global state. Most Filter/Define functions will in fact be pure in the functional programming sense. All actions are built to be thread-safe with the exception of Foreach, in which case users are responsible of thread-safety, see here.\n"},"analysis/python/":{"url":"analysis/python/","title":"Part 8 - Python","keywords":"","body":"An introduction to Python\nPython is a programming language.

The \nanswer is the dot operator ..\n>>> math.sin\n\n\nOperators are special pieces of the syntax of a programming language.\nSyntax is the way you express what you want to do.\nIn Python, an operator acts on the thing that’s on the right of it using the \nthing on the left. In the example we just saw, the dot operator . acts on \nmath in a way that, somehow, retrieves a method called math.sin. We can \nthen use that method straight away:\n>>> math.pi\n3.141592653589793\n>>> math.sin(math.pi)\n1.2246467991473532e-16\n\nHere we see there’s also a property of math called pi, which seems to \nhave the appropriate value.\nWe could also store the result of math.sin in a variable, and use it later.\n>>> twopi = 2*math.pi\n>>> my_sin = math.sin\n>>> my_sin(twopi)\n-2.4492935982947064e-16\n\nThere are several symbols that can be used as operators, like +, -, *, \nand /. Certain things support the use of certain operators. For example, \nnumbers support the plus operator:\n>>> 1 + 2\n3\n\nThe plus operator acts on 1 with 2, and, somehow, 1 knows how to deal \nwith 2, in this case by performing addition as we know it.\nWhen we do 1 + 2, what’s going on behind the scenes is exactly the same as \nwhen do math.sin. Observe!\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__add__(2)\n3\n\nNumbers have a special __add__ method attached to them, in the same way \nthat math has a sin method attached. The plus operator + is just a \nshortcut for accessing this __add__ method. The double underscores either \nside of the name tell you that there’s something special about it; in this case \nit means that you can use the plus operator + instead.\n Methods for other operatorsThe other operators that you can use with numbers have corresponding methods. \nWhat other operator methods are available? Try some of them out, and see how \nthey compare with using the operator like normal.\n SolutionClick to expandWe’ve already met two ways that you can find out what things are attached to \nsomething. In IPython, you can try (1).__, or you can always use the \ndir method.\n>>> dir(1)\n['__abs__',\n '__add__',\n '__and__',\n '__bool__',\n ...\n 'to_bytes']\n\nThen it’s just a case of scanning through this list and seeing what names look \nright. The __sub__ name looks like ‘subtraction’, and similarly __mul__ and \n__truediv__ sound like multiplication and division.\n>>> (1).__mul__(5)\n5\n>>> (1).__truediv__(5)\n0.2\n\n\nOf course, there’s also a method for the dot operator! It’s called \n__getattribute__, and it takes the name of the thing you want to get.\n>>> (1).__add__\n\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')\n\n\nSo, of course, we can do this horrible one-liner:\n>>> (1).__getattribute__('__add__')(3)\n4\n\nYou would never do something like this in your day-to-day programming, but \nwe’ve done it here to illustrate how Python performs operations.\nObjects\nThe use of the dot operator is interesting because we’re manipulating the \nfundamental building block of Python: objects. Objects are containers of \nthings, and we can access those things by name using the dot operator.\nWe can sometimes use other operators as a shorthand for accessing \nspecially-named methods within objects, like using + for __add__.\nMost things in Python are objects! Numbers, like we’ve seen, are objects, \nbecause we can retrieve things from them with ..

Something different happens when we use numbers with and without \ndecimal places! This occurs because numbers given with decimal places, like \n3.14  are floats, while those without, like 3, are integers.\nFor historical reasons, dividing two integers in Python 2 returns an integer, \nwhere the intermediate result is always rounded down. Division using at least \none float gives us the more intuitive answer.\nIn Python 3, division with integers works the same way as with floats. You can \nask to have this behaviour in Python 2.\n>>> from __future__ import division\n>>> 3/4\n0.75\n>>> 3.0/4.0\n0.75\n\nBecause the default behaviour in Python 2 is quite unintuitive, we recommend \nusing the from __future__ import division line everywhere.

For example, you’ve finished an amazing \nanalysis, and want to print the results.\n>>> result1 = 123.0\n>>> result2 = 122.3\n>>> print 'My results are: ' + str(result1) + ', ' + str(result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nThis is already quite ugly, and will only get worse with more results. We can \ninstead use the format method that’s available on strings, and use the \nspecial {} placeholders to say where we want the values to go in the string.\n>>> template = 'My results are: {0}, {1}'\n>>> print template.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3\n\nMuch better! We define the whole string at once, and then place the missing \nvalues in later.\nThe numbers inside the placeholders, {0} and {1}, correspond to the indices \nof the arguments passed to the format method, where 0 is the first \nargument, 1 is the second, and so on. By referencing positions like this, we \ncan easily repeat placeholders in the string, but only pass the values once to \nformat.\n>>> template2 = 'My results are: {0}, {1}. But the best is {0}, obviously.'\n>>> print template2.format(result1, result2)\nMy results are: 123.0, 122.3.

The\nsyntactic difference is that functions take their arguments between parentheses,\nsuch as my_function(1, 2, 3), whereas del does not.\n\nYou can retrieve sub-lists by using slice notation whilst indexing.\n>>> a[1:-1]\n[2, 9]\n\nThis retrieves the part of list a starting from index 1 until just before \nindex -1. The indexing is ‘exclusive’ in that it excludes the item of the \nlast index.

This is called looping, or iterating, and is super easy.\n>>> for item in a:\n...     print item\n...\n4\n2\n9\n45\n\nWe have to indent the code inside the for loop to tell Python that these\nlines should be run for every iteration.\n Indentation in PythonThe for loop is a block, and every Python block requires indentation, unlike\nother \"free-form\" languages such as C++ or Java. This means that Python will\nthrow an error if you don't indent:\n>>> for i in b:\n... print i\n  File \"\", line 2\n    print i\n        ^\nIndentationError: expected an indented block\n\nIndentation must be consistent within the same block, so if you indent two lines\nin the same for loop using a different number of spaces, Python will complain\nonce again:\n>>> for i in b:\n...   print \"I am in a loop\"\n...     print i\n  File \"\", line 3\n    print i\n    ^\nIndentationError: unexpected indent\n\nIndentation is necessary as Python does not use any keyword or symbol to\ndetermine the end of a block (e.g. there is no endfor). As a side effect,\nindentation forces you to make your code more readable!\nNote that it does not matter how many spaces you use for indentation. As a\nconvention, we are using four spaces.\n\nThe variable name item can be whatever we want, but its value is changed by \nPython to be the element of the item we’re currently on, starting from the \nfirst.\nBecause lists are mutable, we can try to modify the length of the list whilst \nwe’re iterating.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     del a_copy[0]\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[9, 45]\n\nIntuitively, you might expect a_copy to be empty, but it’s not! The technical\nreasons aren’t important, but this highlights an important rule: never\nmodify the length of a list whilst iterating over it! You won’t end up with\nwhat you expect.\nYou can, however, freely modify the values of each item in the list whilst \nlooping. This is a very common use case.\n>>> a_copy = a[:]\n>>> i = 0\n>>> for item in a_copy:\n...     a_copy[i] = 2*item\n...     i += 1\n...\n>>> a_copy\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nKeeping track of the current index ourselves, with i is annoying, but luckily \nPython gives us a nicer way of doing that.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n...\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nThere’s a lot going on here. Firstly, note that Python lets you assign values \nto multiple variables at the same time.\n>>> one, two = [34, 43]\n>>> print two, one\n43 34\n\nThat’s already pretty cool! But then think about what happens if you had a list \nwhere each item was another list, each containing two numbers.\n>>> nested = [[20, 29], [30, 34]]\n>>> for item in nested:\n...     print item\n...\n[20, 29]\n[30, 34]\n\nSo, we can just assign each item in the sublist to separate variables in the \nfor statement.\n>>> for one, two in nested:\n...     print two, one\n...\n29 20\n34 30\n\nNow we can understand a little better what enumerate does: for each item in \nthe list, it returns a new list containing the current index and the item.\n>>> enumerate(a)\n\n>>> list(enumerate(a))\n[(0, 4), (1, 2), (2, 9), (3, 45)]\n\nFor performance reasons enumerate doesn’t return a list directly, but instead\nsomething that the for statement knows how to iterate over (this is called a\ngenerator and for the moment you\ndon't need to know how it works). We can convert it to a list with the list\nmethod when we want to see what’s it doing.\nThis technique of looping over lists of lists lets us loop over two lists \nsimultaneously, using the zip method.\n>>> for item, item2 in zip(a, a_doubled):\n...     print item2, item\n...\n8 4\n4 2\n18 9\n90 45\n\nNeat! As before, we can see what zip is doing explicitly by using list.\n>>> list(zip(a, a_doubled))\n[(4, 8), (2, 4), (9, 18), (45, 90)]\n\nYou can see that the structure of the list that’s iterated over, the output of \nzip, is identical to that for enumerate.\nFinally, we’ll take a quick look at the range method.\n>>> range(0, 10)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\nThe arguments to range work just like slicing, the second argument is treated \nexclusively, as its value is excluded from the output. Again like slicing, we \ncan specify a third argument as the step size for the iteration.\n>>> range(0, 10, 2)\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\nIf you only give a single argument to range, it assumes you’ve given the end \nvalue, and want a starting value of zero.\n>>> range(5)\n[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n\nThis reads “give me a list of length 5, in steps of 1, starting from zero”.\nNow that we know how to easily generate sequences of numbers, we can write \nenumerate by hand!\n>>> for index, item in zip(range(len(a)), a):\n...     print index, item\n...\n0 4\n1 2\n2 9\n3 45\n\nJust like before! When you see something cool like enumerate, it can be fun \ntrying to see how you’d accomplish something similar with different building \nblocks.\nList comprehension\nWe’ve already made a new list from an existing one when we created a_doubled.\n>>> a_doubled = a[:]\n>>> for index, item in enumerate(a_doubled):\n...     a_doubled[index] = 2*item\n\nCreating a new list from an existing one is a common operation, so Python has a \nshorthand syntax called list comprehension.\n>>> a_doubled = [2*item for item in a]\n>>> a_doubled\n[8, 4, 18, 90]\n\nIsn’t that beautiful?\nWe can use the same multi-variable stuff we learnt whilst looping.\n>>> [index*item for index, item in enumerate(a)]\n[0, 2, 18, 135]\n\nWe’re not restricted to creating new lists with the same structure as the \noriginal.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4], [9, 81], [45, 2025]]\n\nWe can even filter out items from the original list using if.\n>>> [[item, item*item] for item in a if item % 2 == 0]\n[[4, 16], [2, 4]]\n\nList comprehensions are a powerful way of succinctly creating new lists. But be \nresponsible; if you find you’re doing something complicated, it’s probably \nbetter to write a full for loop.\nTuples\nA close relative of lists are tuples, which differ in that they cannot be \nmutated after creation.  You can create tuples literally using parentheses, or \nconvert things to tuples using the tuple method.\n>>> a = (3, 4)\n>>> del a[0]\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion\n>>> a.append(5)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nAttributeError: 'tuple' object has no attribute 'append'\n>>> a[0] = 1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n>>> b = tuple([65, 'yes'])\n>>> b\n(65, 'yes')\n\nTuples are usually used to describe data whose length is meaningful in and of \nitself. For example, you could express coordinates as a tuple.\n>>> coords = (3.2, 0.1)\n>>> x, y = coords\n\nThis is nice because it doesn’t make sense to append to an (x,y)(x, y)(x,y) \ncoordinate, nor to ‘delete’ a dimension. Generally, it can be useful if the \ndata structure you’re using respects the meaning of the data you’re storing.\nIf you can’t think of a use for tuples yourself, its worth keeping in mind that \nPython creates tuples for groups of things by default. We saw that \nearlier when we used enumerate.\n>>> list(enumerate([4, 9]))\n[(0, 4), (1, 9)]\n\nEach element of the list is a tuple.\n Write a list comprehension yourselfCompute the square of the magnitude of the sum of the following two \nthree-vectors, using a single list comprehension and the global sum method.\n>>> kaon = [3.4, 4.3, 20.0]\n>>> pion = [1.4, 0.9, 19.8]\n\nIt might help to first think about how you’d compute the quantity for a single \nvector.\n SolutionClick to expandNot sure what the sum method does? Ask for help!\n>>> help(sum)\n\nThe square magnitude is the sum of the squares of the components, where the \ncomponents are the sum of the two input vectors.\n>>> magsq = sum([(k + pi)**2 for k, pi in zip(kaon, pion)])\n\nThe square root of this is around 40.42.\n\n"},"analysis/python/dictionaries.html":{"url":"analysis/python/dictionaries.html","title":"Dictionaries","keywords":"","body":"Dictionaries\nYou can think of lists as a mapping from indices to values. The indices are\nalways integers and go from 0 to len(the_list), and the values are the\nitems.\nDictionaries are collections, just like lists, but they have important\ndifferences:\n\nlists map sequential numeric indices to items, whereas dictionaries can map\nmost object types to any object,\nlists are ordered collections of items, whereas dictionaries have no\nordering.\n\nSince anything can be used as index for an item, indices must be always\nspecified when creating a dictionary:\n>>> d = {1: 0.5, 'excellent index': math.sin, 0.1: 2}\n>>> d[1]\n0.5\n>>> d['excellent index']\n\n>>> d[0.1] = 3\n\nThe \"indices\" of a dictionary are called keys, and the things they map to\nare values.

If you run the same example on\nyour own you might get a different ordering. This is what we mean when we define\ndictionaries as unordered collections: when you iterate over its content, you\ncannot rely on the ordering.\nIt is however guaranteed that the n-th item returned by keys() corresponds\nto the n-th item returned by values(). This allows the following example\nto work flawlessly:\n>>> for key, value in zip(d.keys(), d.values()):\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nOf course, this could be considerably simpler just by using items(), which\ngives us tuples of key-value pairs.\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, ':', value\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe can create dictionaries from lists of 2-item lists.\n>>> dict(enumerate(['a thing', 'another']))\n{0: 'a thing', 1: 'another'}\n\nAnd also with dictionary comprehensions, in a similar manner to list\ncomprehensions, with the additional specification of the key.\n>>> {i: i**i for i in range(5) if i != 3}\n{0: 1, 1: 1, 2: 4, 4: 256, 5: 3125}\n\nNote that dictionary comprehensions require at least Python 2.7 to work.\nDictionary keys\nThere’s no restriction on values a dictionary might hold, but there is on keys.\n>>> l = [1, 4, 3]\n>>> dd = {}\n>>> dd[l] = 0\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: unhashable type: 'list'\n\nIn essence, keys must not be mutable. This includes numbers, strings, and\ntuples, but not lists.

When you\nlook up an item in a Python dictionary with my_dict[\"my_key\"], what happens\ninternally is:\n\nhash of \"my_key\" is calculated,\nthis number is compared to every hash of every key in the dictionary, until a\nmatch between the hashes is found,\nif two hashes match, and the two objects are really identical, the\ncorresponding dictionary item is returned.\n\nLooking up numbers instead of strings or tuples is considerably faster, but\nsince two different strings can have the same hash, their content has to be\ncompared as well to really tell whether they are equal. If two hashes are\ndifferent on the other hand we are sure that the objects are different as well.\n\nIteration over dictionaries is over their keys.\n>>> for key in d:\n...     print key, ':' d[key]\n...\n1 : 0.5\n0.1 : 3\nexcellent index : \n\nWe have already seen how to iterate over values (using d.values()) or keys\nand values simultaneously (using d.items()).\n On the efficiency of items()In Python 2, using items copies the keys and values of a dictionary, and gives\nyou back those copies. This can be problematic for large dictionaries as the\namount of memory your program uses can double. Python 3 uses a much more\nmemory-efficient way of implementing items so that you don't have to worry.\nIf you're having memory problems with using items in Python 2, you can use\nviewitems() instead, which behaves the same way as items does in Python 3.\nNote that there are also similar methods for keys and values, called\nviewkeys() and viewvalues(), and that all of these view methods are only\navailable from\nPython 2.7.\n\n Alphabet mappingMap each letter of the alphabet to a number with a dictionary comprehension,\nstarting with 0 for a and ending with 25 for z.\nYou can get a string containing the letters of the alphabet like this:\n>>> import string\n>>> string.ascii_lowercase\n'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\nYou can iterate over a string exactly like a list.\n>>> for character in string.ascii_lowercase:\n...     print character\n...\na\nb\n...\nz\n\nThen, create the \"reverse\" dictionary, again with a comprehension, mapping\nletters to numbers.\n SolutionClick to expandYou need to have a list containing one number per letter, and to loop over that\nlist along with the characters in the string. This is exactly the same as\nlooping over items in a list alongside the index, so we can use enumerate.\n>>> alphabet_map = {i: c for i, c in enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase)}\n\nWe can create the inverse map by swapping the key and value in the\ncomprehension.\n>>> reverse_map = {c: i for i, c in alphabet_map.items()}\n\n\n"},"analysis/python/conditions.html":{"url":"analysis/python/conditions.html","title":"Conditions","keywords":"","body":"Conditions\nSometimes, often while looping, you only want to do things depending on\nsomething’s value.

Methods\nare normally used to encapsulate small pieces of code that we want to reuse.\nLet’s rewrite len as an example.\n>>> def length(obj):\n...     \"\"\"Return the number of elements in obj.\n...\n...     obj must be iterable.\n...     \"\"\"\n...     i = 0\n...     for _ in obj:\n...         i += 1\n...     return i\n>>> length\n\n>>> help(length)\nHelp on function length in module __main__:\n\nlength(obj)\n    Return the number of elements in obj.\n\n    obj must be iterable.\n>>> length('A b c!')\n6\n>>> length(range(5))\n5\n\nThere’s a lot going on here, so we will break it down line-by-line.\n\ndef length(obj): methods are defined using def, followed by a space,\nand then the name you want to give the method.1 Inside the parentheses\nafter the name, we list the inputs, or arguments, that we want our method\nto accept.  In this case, we only need a single input: the thing we want to\ncompute the length of.  Finally, there’s a colon at the end, just like with\na for or if, which means a block of code follows (which must be\nindented).\n\"\"\"Return the number of elements in obj.\"\"\": This is the docstring. It’s\njust a documentation string, defined literally with three double quotes so that we can\ninclude linebreaks. By placing a string here, Python makes the string\navailable to use when we pass our function to help. Documenting your\nfunctions is a very good idea! It makes it clear to others, and to\nfuture-you, what the method is supposed to do.\nThe method block. This is the code that will run whenever you call your\nmethod, like length([1]). The code in the block has access to the\narguments and to any variables defined before the method definition.>>> x = 1\n>>> def top_function():\n...    \"\"\"Do something silly.\"\"\"\n...    print x\n...    print y\n...\n>>> y = 2\n>>> top_function()\n1\nTraceback (most recent call last):\nFile \"\", line 1, in \nFile \"\", line 3, in top_function\nNameError: global name 'y' is not defined\n\nIn general, you should try to minimise the number of variables outside your\nmethod that you use inside. It makes figuring out what the method does much\nharder, as you have to look elsewhere in the code to find things out.\nreturn i: This defines the output of the method, the thing that you get\nback when you call the method. You don’t have to return anything, in which\ncase Python will implicitly make your function return None, or you can\nreturn multiple things at once.>>> def no_return():\n...     1 + 1\n...\n>>> no_return()\n>>> no_return() == None\n>>> def such_output():\n...     return 'wow', 'much clever', 213\n...\n>>> such_output()\n('wow', 'much clever', 213)\n>>> a, b, c = such_output()\n>>> b\n'much clever'\n\nYou can see that returning multiple things implicitly means returning a\ntuple, so we can choose to assign one variable per value while calling the\nmethod.\n\n\n1. Names are conventionally in lowercase, with underscores separating words. ↩\n\nMethods can be called in several ways.\n>>> def add(x, y):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\"\"\"\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> add(1, 2)\n>>> add(x=1, y=2)\n>>> add(1, y=2)\n>>> add(y=2, x=1)\n>>> add(y=2, 1)\n  File \"\", line 1\nSyntaxError: non-keyword arg after keyword arg\n>>> add(y=2, =1)\n  File \"\", line 1\n    add(y=2, =1)\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nSpecifying the argument’s name explicitly when calling a method is nice because\nit reminds you what the argument is supposed to do. It also means you don’t\nhave to remember the order in which the arguments were defined, you can specify\nkeyword arguments in any order. You can even mix positional arguments with\nkeyword arguments, but any keyword arguments must come last.\nUsing keyword arguments is particularly useful for arguments which act as\non/off flags, because it’s often not obvious what your True or False is\ndoing.\n>>> def add(x, y, show):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...    Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, True) # Hmm, what is True doing again?\n3\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True) # Aha! Much clearer\n\nAlways having to specify that flag is annoying. It would be much nicer if\nshow had a default value, so that we don’t have to provide a value when\ncalling the method, but can optionally override it.\n>>> def add(x, y, show=False):\n...    \"\"\"Return the sum of x and y.\n...\n...    Optionally print the result before returning it.\n...    \"\"\"\n...    if show:\n...        print x + y\n...    return x + y\n...\n>>> _ = add(1, 2) # No printing!\n>>> _ = add(1, 2, show=True)\n3\n\nPerfect.\nOf course, function arguments can be anything, even other functions!\n>>> def run_method(method, x):\n...     \"\"\"Call `method` with `x`.\"\"\"\n...     return method(x)\n...\n>>> run_method(len, [1, 2, 3])\n3\n\n Methods returning methodsWhat does this method do?\n>>> def make_incrementor(increment):\n...     def func(var):\n...         return var + increment\n...     return func\n\n SolutionClick to expandIt returns a function whose increment value has been filled by the argument\nto make_incrementor. If we called make_incrementor(3), then increment has\nthe value 3, and we can fill in the returned method in our heads.\ndef func(var):\n    return var + 3\n\nSo when we call this method, we’ll get back what we put in, but plus 3.\n>>> increment_one = make_incrementator(1)\n>>> increment_two = make_incrementator(2)\n>>> print increment_one(42), increment_two(42)\n43 44\n>>> print make_incrementator(3)(42) # Do it in one go!\n45\n\n\nWhat if you like to accept an arbitrary number of arguments? For example, we\ncan also write a total method that takes two arguments.\n>>> def total(x, y):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return x + y\n...\n>>>\n\nBut what if we want to allow the caller to pass more than two arguments? It\nwould be tedious to define many arguments explicitly.\n>>> def total(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `*` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(args), args)\n...     return sum(args)\n...\n>>> total(1)\nGot 1 arguments: (1,)\n1\n>>> total(1, 2)\nGot 2 arguments: (1, 2)\n3\n>>> total(1, 2, 3)\nGot 3 arguments: (1, 2, 3)\n6\n\nThe *args syntax says “stuff any arguments into a tuple and call it args”.\nThis let’s us capture any number of arguments. As args is a tuple, one could\nloop over it, access a specific element, and so on.\nWe can also expand lists into separate arguments with the same syntax when\ncalling a method.\n>>> def reverse_args(x, y):\n...     return y, x\n...\n>>> l = ['a', 'b']\n>>> reverse_args(l)\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"\", line 1, in \nTypeError: reverse_args() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)\n>>> reverse_args(*l)\n('b', 'a')\n\nA similar syntax exists for keyword arguments.\n>>> def ages(**people):\n...     \"\"\"Print people's information.\"\"\"\n...     # For seeing what `**` does\n...     print 'Got {0} arguments: {1}'.format(len(people), people)\n...     for person in people:\n...         print 'Person {0} is {1}'.format(person, people[person])\n...\n>>> ages(steve=31)\nGot 1 arguments: {'steve': 31}\nPerson steve is 31\n>>> ages(steve=31, helen=70, zorblax=9963)\nGot 3 arguments: {'steve': 31, 'zorblax': 9963, 'helen': 70}\nPerson steve is 31\nPerson zorblax is 9963\nPerson helen is 70\n\nAs you can see from the debug print statement, **people is a dictionary\ncontaining the keyword arguments we passed to the ages method. The keys of\nthe dictionary are the names of the argument as strings, and the values are the\nvalues of the arguments. Just like for the * syntax, ** can also be used to\nexpand a dictionary into keyword arguments.\n>>> d = {'thor': 5000, 'yoda': -1}\n>>> ages(**d)\nGot 2 arguments: {'yoda': -1, 'thor': 5000}\nPerson yoda is -1\nPerson thor is 5000\n\nThe order of the keyword arguments used to call the method are not necessarily\nthe same as those that the function block sees!\nThis is because dictionaries are unordered, and the ** syntax effectively creates a dictionary.\n The most generic methodThe most generic method would take any number of positional arguments and any\nnumber of keyword arguments. What would this method look like?\n SolutionClick to expandIt would use both * and ** syntax in defining the arguments.\n>>> def generic(*args, **kwargs):\n...     print 'Got args: {0}'.format(args)\n...     print 'Got kwargs: {0}'.format(kwargs)\n...\n>>> d = {'bing': 'baz'}\n>>> generic(1, 2, 'abc', foo='bar', **d)\nGot args: (1, 2, 'abc')\nGot kwargs: {'bing': 'baz', 'foo': 'bar'}\n\n\nInline methods\nSome methods take other methods as arguments, like the built-in map method.\n>>> map(str, range(5))\n['0', '1', '2', '3', '4']\n\nmap takes a function and an iterable, and applies the function to each element in\nthe iterable. It returns a new list with the results. We can define and then pass\nour own functions.\n>>> def cube(x):\n...     \"\"\"Return the third power of x.\"\"\"\n...     return x*x*x\n...\n>>> map(cube, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nFor such a simple method, this is a lot of typing! We can use a lambda function to\ndefine such simple methods inline.\n>>> map(lambda x: x*x*x, range(5))\n[0, 1, 8, 27, 64]\n\nThe syntax of defining a lambda is like this:\nlambda : \n is a command-separate set of variables that the lambda can take as\narguments, and  is the code that is run. A lambda\nautomatically returns whatever the result of the expression is, you don’t need\na return (the return is implicit).\nWriting a lambda statement defines a method, which you can capture as a\nvariable just like any other object.\n>>> div2 = lambda x: x/2\n>>> div2\n at 0x7fc6b2207758>\n>>> map(div2, range(5))\n[0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0]\n\nNote that we got real numbers back because we are using Python 2 with from __future__ import division.\n Sum in quadratureWrite a method that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments, and returns the\nsum of the arguments computed in quadrature. A “sum in quadrature” is the\nsquare root of the sum of the squares of each number. You should use lambda\nto define a squaring and a square root function, and map to apply the\nsquaring method.\n SolutionClick to expandWe need a little square root method and a method to square its input.\n>>> square = lambda x: x*x\n>>> sqrt = lambda x: x**0.5\n\nWe then define a method that can accept any number of arguments using the\n*args syntax, and use map to call the square method on the list of\narguments. Then we can call sum on the result, and then sqrt.\n>>> def quadrature(*args):\n...     \"\"\"Return the sum in quadrature of the arguments.\"\"\"\n...     return sqrt(sum(map(square, args)))\n...\n>>> quadrature(1, 1) # should be equal to sqrt(2)\n1.4142135623730951\n>>> 2**0.5\n1.4142135623730951\n\n\nAnother use case for lambda is the built-in filter method (see:\nhelp(filter)).\n>>> filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, range(10))   # filter and return the even numbers only\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n List comprehensionHow would you rewrite the filter example above using a list comprehension?\n SolutionClick to expand>>> [ x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 ]\n[0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n\n\nGenerally, you should only use lambda methods to define little throw-away\nmethods. The main downside with using them is that you can’t attach a docstring\nto them, and they become unwieldy when there’s complex logic.\n"},"analysis/python/scripting.html":{"url":"analysis/python/scripting.html","title":"Scripting","keywords":"","body":"Scripting\nOK, so we’ve spent quite a long time in Python shells.

Actually, that is pretty much all there is to\nthem.\nUsing modules into your code: import\nThe keyword import, usually specified at the beginning of your source code, is\nused to tell Python what modules you want to make available to your current\ncode.\nThere are different ways of specifying an import. The one we have seen already\nsimply makes the module available to you:\n>>> import random\n>>> random.uniform(0, 1)\n0.5877109428927353\n\nThe module random contains functions useful for random number generation: with\nthe import above, we have made the random module accessible, and everything\nwithin that module is accessible via the syntax random.. For the record,\nthe uniform(x,y) method returns a pseudo-random number within the range\n[x,y][x,y][x,y].\nSometimes you want to make only one or more things from a given module\naccessible: Python gives you the ability to import just those:\n>>> from random import uniform, choice\n>>> uniform(0, 1)\n0.4059007502204043\n>>> choice([ 33, 56, 42, -1 ])\n42\n\nIn this case the uniform and choice names are available directly, i.e.\nwithout using the random prefix. All other functions in the random module\nare not available in this case. For the record, the choice function returns a\nrandom element from a given collection.\nAnother option is to import all functions of a certain module and make them\navailable without a prefix:\n>>> from random import *\n>>> gauss(0, 1)\n-1.639334770284028\n\nThis is not that recommended as you generally do not know what is the extent\nof what you are importing and you might end up with name clashes between your\ncurrent code and the imported module, as it will all be in the same namespace,\nmeaning directly available with no need for a . syntax. \nLastly, it is possible to import modules, or specific names from a module,\nunder an alias.\n>>> from random import uniform as uni\n>>> uni(0, 1)\n0.7288973406605329\n>>> import numpy as np\nnp.arccos(1)\n0.0\n\nThis option is useful when you need to assign shorter aliases to names you will\nuse frequently. In particular, the alias np for the numpy module will be\nencountered a lot.\nNote that modules can have submodules, specified with extra dots .:\n>>> from os.path import abspath\n>>> abspath('..')\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d'\n\nWhen importing a module, its submodules are not available by default and you\nmust import them explicitly:\n>>> import os\n>>> os.getcwd()\n'/afs/cern.ch/user/d/dberzano'\n>>> import os.path\n>>> os.path.basename(os.getcwd())\n'dberzano'\n\nNote that due to the current Python implementation of the os module, os.path\nfunctions are actually available even without importing os.path. But just\nos. You cannot and should not rely on this implementation, which represents an exception\nand might change in the future. Always import submodules explicitly!\nIt is also possible to import several modules with a single import command:\n>>> import os, sys, math\n\nbut this is not recommended by the Python style guide, which\nsuggests to use several import statements, one per module, as it improves\nreadability:\n>>> import os\n>>> import sys\n>>> import math\n\nIf you need to import several names from a single module, you can split an import\nfunction over multiple lines:\n>>> from math import (\n...     exp,\n...     log,\n...     e,\n...     floor\n... )\n>>> floor(exp(log(e)))\n2.0\n\nThe standard library\nThe set of things that Python comes with, from all of the types of objects to\nall of the different modules, is called the standard library. It is\nrecommended to browse through the standard library documentation to see what is\navailable: Python is rich of standard modules, and you should reuse them as much\nas possible instead of rewriting code on your own.\nSome of the categories for which standard modules are available are:\n\nprocessing paths\ndate and time manipulation\nmathematical functions\nparsing of certain file formats\nsupport for multiple processes and threads\n...\n\nUse standard Python library modules with confidence: being part of any standard\nPython distribution, your code will be easily portable.\nModules from PyPi\nMany external modules can be found on PyPi, the Python Package Index repository.\nSome of those modules are\nalready part of some Python distributions (such as Anaconda, which\ncomes with more than a thousand science-oriented modules preinstalled).\nIf a certain module you need is not available on your distribution you can\neasily install it with the pip shell command. Since you typically do not have write\naccess to the standard Python installation's directories, pip allows you to\ninstall modules only for yourself, under your current user's home directory.\nIt is recommended to set up in your shell startup script (such as ~/.bashrc)\nthe following two lines telling once and for all where to install and search for\nPython user modules:\nexport PYTHONUSERBASE=$HOME/.local\nexport PATH=$PYTHONUSERBASE/bin:$PATH\n\nOnce you have done that, close your current terminal window and open a new one,\nand you will be ready to use pip. We will see in a later lesson how to install\nthe root_pandas module with:\npip install --user root_pandas\n\nWrite your first Python module\nThe simplest Python module you can write is just a .py file with some\nfunctions inside:\n# myfirstmodule.py\n\ndef one():\n    print('this is my first function')\n\ndef two():\n    print('this is my second function')\n\nYou can now fire an ipython shell and use those functions right away:\n>>> import myfirstmodule\n>>> myfirstmodule.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> myfirstmodule.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nBy simply calling the file myfirstmodule.py we have made it available as a\nmodule named myfirstmodule - given that the file is in the same directory\nwhere we have launched the Python interpreter.\n Module name restrictionsNote that you cannot pick any name you want for a module! From the\n[Python style guide][pep8-modulenames], we gather that we should use \"short,\nall-lowercase names\". As a matter of fact, if we used dashes in the file name,\nwe would have ended up with a syntax error while trying to load it:\n>>> import my-first-module\n  File \"\", line 1\n    import my-first-module\n             ^\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\n\nPython treats - as a minus and does not understand your intentions.\n\nWrite a structured module\nLet's now create a more structured module, with submodules and different files.\nWe can start from the myfirstmodule.py file and create a directory structure:\n$ mkdir yabba\n$ cp myfirstmodule.py yabba/__init__.py\n\nWe have reused the same file created before, copied it into a directory called\nyabba and renamed it to __init__.py. The double underscore should ring a\nbell: this is a Python special name, and it represents the \"main file\" within\na module, whereas the directory name now represents the module name.\nThis means that our module is called yabba, and if we import it, functions\nfrom __init__.py will be available:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> yabba.one()\nthis is my first function\n>>> yabba.two()\nthis is my second function\n\nWe can create an additional file inside the yabba directory, say\nyabba/extra.py and have more functions there:\n# yabba/extra.py\n\ndef three():\n  print 'this function will return the number three'\n  return 3\n\nWe have effectively made extra a submodule of yabba. Let's try:\n>>> import yabba\n>>> filter(lambda x: not x.startswith('__'), dir(yabba))\n['one', 'two']\n>>> import yabba.extra\n>>> yabba.extra.three()\nyabba.extra.three()\nthis function will return the number three\n3\n\n What have I done with the filter function?We have used the filter function above to list the functions we have defined\nin our module. Can you describe in detail what the commands above do?\n SolutionClick to expandThe dir(module) command lists all names (not necessarily functions, not\nnecessarily defined by us) contained in a given imported module. We have used the\nfilter() command to filter out all names starting with two underscores. Every\nitem returned by dir() is passed as x to the lambda function which returns\nTrue or False, determining whether the filter() function should keep or\ndiscard the current element.\n\nRun a module\nWe can make a Python module that can be easily imported by other Python\nprograms, but we can also make it in a way that it can be run directly as a\nPython script.\nLet's write this special module and call it runnable.py:\n#!/usr/bin/env python\n\nlong_format = False\n\ndef print_label(label, msg):\n    if long_format:\n        out = '{0}: {1}'.format(label.upper(), str(msg))\n    else:\n        out = '{0}-{1}'.format(label[0].upper(), str(msg))\n    print out\n\ndef debug(msg):\n    print_label('debug', msg)\n\ndef warning(msg):\n    print_label('warning', msg)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print '*** Testing print functions ***'\n    debug('This is a debug message')\n    long_format = True\n    warning('This is a warning message with a long label')\nelse:\n    print 'Module {0} is being imported'.format(__name__)\n\nNow let's make it executable:\n$ chmod +x runnable.py\n\nIt can be now run as a normal executable from your shell:\n$ ./runnable.py\n*** Testing print functions ***\nD-This is a debug message\nWARNING: This is a warning message with a long label\nThere are two outstanding notions here. First off, the first line is a\n\"shebang\": it really has to be the first line in a file (it cannot be the\nsecond, or \"one of the first\", or the first non-empty) and it basically tells\nyour shell that your executable text file has to be interpreted by the current\nPython interpreter. Just use this line as it is.\nSecondly, we notice we have a peculiar if condition with a block that gets\nexecuted when we run the file. __name__ is a special internal Python variable\nwhich is set to the module name in case the module is imported. When the module\nis ran, it is set to the special value \"__main__\".\nThe else: condition we have added is just to show what happens when you import\nthe module instead:\n>>> import runnable\nModule runnable is being imported\n>>> runnable.warning('hey I can use it from here too')\nW-hey I can use it from here too\n\nNow, the if condition is not necessary when you want to run the module - those\nlines in the if block will be executed anyway. It is however used to prevent\nsome lines from being executed when you import the file as a module.\nPlease also note that module imports are typically silent, so the else:\ncondition with a printout would not exist in real life.\n"},"analysis/python/learning.html":{"url":"analysis/python/learning.html","title":"Learning more","keywords":"","body":"Learning more\nLearning Python is like learning… well, like learning a language! You must \npractice reading and writing regularly, and as you do you’ll become more and \nmore comfortable, starting to get a feeling for how things work, and how to \neffectively express yourself.\nProgramming is a career in and of itself, so as physicists we have twice as \nmuch work to do! It takes people many years to get comfortable with any \nlanguage, so try not to get too frustrated if things seem complicated at the \nbeginning. It gets better!\nWhen you do get stuck, ask friends and colleagues for help. One of the great \nthings about Python is that many people around the world use it, and it’s very \npopular in high energy physics, so you likely already know someone who can help \nsolve your problem. Working on code with others is a great way to learn, as you \ncan see how other people do things, and find out tricks you didn’t know about.\nBeyond other people, Google is a powerful ally. Knowing how to express your \nproblem is important in getting the best answers quickly. Generally, including \na few words as possible is a good idea, like “python dictionary delete \nkey”, or “python read file lines”.\nStack Overflow is an excellent resource, with \ncommunity-provided answers for many programming-related questions. Most \nproblems you encounter will already be answered there, and often the answers \nare quite didactic, providing context and further reading, beyond just posting \nthe code that answers the question (these answers aren’t always the ones marked \nas the ‘best answer’, and don’t always have the most votes).\nExploring Python\nThe Python standard library is a treasure-trove of useful objects and methods. \nWe’ve gone through a tiny subset of them here, some others that might be useful \nto you are:\n\nos: Operating system functions to manipulate and query your machine and the \nfile system, like os.mkdir to make directories and os.rename.\ntempfile: create files and directories in a temporary location, like\n/tmp, e.g. tempfile.mkdtemp.\nglob: File name matching, to be able to do things like ls folder/*.txt in \nPython with glob.glob('folder/*.txt').\nsubprocess: Call shell commands with subprocess.call(['ls', '-l', '-a']).\ntime: Get the current time with time.localtime().tm_hour.\ncollections: Use collections.namedtuple to create your own property-only\nobjects.>>> import collections\n>>> Coordinate = collections.namedtuple('Coordinate', ['x', 'y'])\n>>> coord = Coordinate(4.5, 2.0)\n>>> coord.y\n2.0\n>>> x, y = coord\n>>> x\n4.5\n\nUse collections.OrderedDict for ordered dictionaries.>>> d = {'foo': 'bar', 123: 321, 'hero': 'thor'}\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\n123 321\nfoo bar\nhero thor\n>>> d = collections.OrderedDict([('foo', 'bar'), (123, 321)])\n>>> d.update([('hero', 'thor')])\n>>> for key, value in d.items():\n...     print key, value\n...\nfoo bar\n123 321\nhero thor\n\ncollections.defaultdict is useful for creating dictionaries that will create \nautomatically create values when a previously undefined key is accessed.>>> d = collections.defaultdict(int)\n>>> d['foo'] += 1\n>>> print d, d['foo'], d['bar']\ndefaultdict(, {'foo': 1}) 1 0\n\n\n\nConventional coding\n‘Pythonic code’ is code that follows the conventions of the wider Python \ncommunity. Lots of people write Python, and by following certain stylistic \nconventions it makes it easier for everyone to read each other’s code (as they \nsay: ‘you spend 90% of your time reading code, and 10% writing it’).\nPythonic style emphasises clean, readable code, with consistent formatting and \nuseful comments. The most important thing is to be consistent. You can consult \nPEP8, the official Python style recommendations, if you're unsure or\nwant to settle a dispute like lower_case_functions versus \nupperCaseFunctions. Which of these two methods is easier to read?\nimport time\n\n\ndef myFunc(x,y,verbose = True, fast='yes'):\n    \"\"\"Do the thing.\"\"\"\n    z=( x *y ) /2\n    if verbose == False:\n        print x,y, z\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep( 1 )\n    return  z* z\n\n\ndef my_func(x, y, verbose=True, fast=True):\n    \"\"\"Return ((x*y)/2)**2.\n\n    Keyword arguments:\n    x, y -- Values used in the computation\n    verbose -- Print computation information\n    fast -- If True, sleep for 1 second before returning\n    \"\"\"\n    z = (x*y)/2\n\n    if verbose:\n        print x, y, z\n    # Should probably remove this functionality\n    if not fast:\n        time.sleep(1)\n\n    return z*z\n\nThe Zen of Python summarises the ‘philosophy’ that the language tries to \nfollow.

Now, it's time to make the connection between ROOT and Python, and see why Python can be pretty convenient. \nPython bindings\nMany existing third-party applications and libraries have so-called \"Python bindings\". \n BindingsBinding generally refers to a mapping of one thing to another. In the context of software libraries, bindings are wrapper libraries that bridge two programming languages, so that a library written for one language can be used in another language.\nMany software libraries are written in system programming languages such as C or C++. To use such libraries from another language, usually of higher-level, a binding to the library must be created in that language, possibly requiring recompiling the language's code, depending on the amount of modification needed. However, most languages offer a foreign function interface, such as Python's ctypes.\n\nPyROOT provides Python bindings for ROOT: it enables cross-calls from ROOT/Cling into Python and vice versa, the intermingling of the two interpreters, and the transport of user-level objects from one interpreter to the other. PyROOT enables access from ROOT to any application or library that itself has Python bindings, and it makes all ROOT functionality directly available from the python interpreter.\nThe Python scripting language is widely used for scientific programming, including high performance and distributed parallel code (see http://www.scipy.org). It is the second most popular scripting language (after Perl) and enjoys a wide-spread use as a “glue language”: practically every library and application these days comes with Python bindings (and if not, they can be easily written or generated).\nPyROOT, a Python extension module, provides the bindings for the ROOT class library in a generic way using the Cling dictionary. This way, it allows the use of any ROOT classes from the Python interpreter, and thus the “glue-ing” of ROOT libraries with any non-ROOT library or applications that provide Python bindings. \nAccess to ROOT from Python\nThere are several tools for scientific analysis that come with bindings that allow the use of these tools from the Python interpreter. PyROOT provides this for users who want to do analysis in Python with ROOT classes. The following example shows how to fill and display a ROOT histogram while working in Python. Of course, any actual analysis code may come from somewhere else through other bindings, e.g. from a C++ program.\nWhen run, the next example will display a 1-dimensional histogram showing a Gaussian distribution. \nfrom ROOT import gRandom,TCanvas,TH1F\n\nc1 = TCanvas('c1','Example',200,10,700,500)\nhpx = TH1F('hpx','px',100,-4,4)\n\nfor i in xrange(25000):\n    px = gRandom.Gaus()\n    hpx.Fill(px)\n\nhpx.Draw()\nc1.Update()\n\n Make sure that PyROOT is enabledTo make use of the Python Bindings of ROOT, make sure that the build of the PyROOT module is enabeled when you compile ROOT. If you use ROOT through aliBuild, ROOT6 is built with python support out-of-the-box. For ROOT5 based builds, PyROOT support is disabeled by default in aliBuild. For a manual build of ROOT, Python bindings are enabled by default, but can be disabled via the CMake options.\nTo load the ROOT module in your Python code, make sure that libPyROOT.so and the ROOT.py module can be resolved by the system by entering your (Ali)ROOT environment. \n\nAccess to ROOT classes\nBefore a ROOT class can be used from Python, its dictionary needs to be loaded into the current process. This happens automatically for all classes that are declared to the auto-loading mechanism through so-called rootmap files. Effectively, this means that all classes in the ROOT distributions are directly available for import. For example:\nfrom ROOT import TCanvas          # available at startup\nc = TCanvas()\n\nfrom ROOT import TLorentzVector   # triggers auto-load of libPhysics\nl = TLorentzVector()\n\nAlthough it is not recommended, a simple way of working with PyROOT is doing a global import:\nfrom ROOT import *\n\nc = TCanvas()\nl = TLorentzVector()\n\nKeeping the ROOT namespace (“import ROOT”), or only importing from ROOT those classes that you will actually use (see above), however, will always be cleaner and clearer:\nimport ROOT\n\nc = ROOT.TCanvas()\nl = ROOT.TLorentzVector()\n\nSome simple examples\nfrom ROOT import TF1, TCanvas\n\nclass Linear:\n    def __call__( self, x, par ):\n        return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]\n\n# create a linear function with offset 5, and pitch 2\nf = TF1('pyf2',Linear(),-1.,1.,2)\nf.SetParameters(5.,2.)\n\n# plot the function\nc = TCanvas()\nf.Draw()\n\nFitting a histogram\nYou have seen in the previous section that we can resolve all ROOT classes through python bindings. \n Fitting a histogramTake the code example from the previous section as a starting point, and write a simple piece of python code that\n\ndefines a linear function\nfills a histogram with some linearly distributed data\nfits the linear function to the histogram\n\n Click to check possible solutionClick to expandfrom ROOT import TF1, TH1F, TCanvas\n\nclass Linear:\n    def __call__( self, x, par ):\n        return par[0] + x[0]*par[1]\n\n# create a linear function for fitting\nf = TF1('pyf3',Linear(),-1.,1.,2)\n\n# create and fill a histogram\nh = TH1F('h','test',100,-1.,1.)\nf2 = TF1('cf2','6.+x*4.5',-1.,1.)\nh.FillRandom('cf2',10000)\n\n# fit the histo with the python 'linear' function\nh.Fit(f)\n\n# print results\npar = f.GetParameters()\nprint('fit results: const =', par[0], ',pitch =', par[1])\n\n\nAdvanced examples: working with trees\nNext to making histograms, working with trees is probably the most common part of any analysis. The TTree implementation uses pointers and dedicated buffers to reduce the memory usage and to speed up access. Consequently, mapping TTree functionality to Python is not straightforward.\nLet us assume that you have a file containing TTrees, TChains, or TNtuples and want to read the contents for use in your analysis code. The following example code outlines the main steps :\n But first ... create a treeTo run the Python code below, you need a small tree\n Click here for a generic example which fills a suitable treeClick to expandPlace the following in a file called tree1.C\n\n#include \"TROOT.h\"\n#include \"TFile.h\"\n#include \"TTree.h\"\n#include \"TBrowser.h\"\n#include \"TH2.h\"\n#include \"TRandom.h\"\n\nvoid tree1w()\n{\n   //create a Tree file tree1.root\n\n   //create the file, the Tree and a few branches\n   TFile f(\"tree1.root\",\"recreate\");\n   TTree t1(\"t1\",\"a simple Tree with simple variables\");\n   Float_t px, py, pz;\n   Double_t random;\n   Int_t ev;\n   t1.Branch(\"px\",&px,\"px/F\");\n   t1.Branch(\"py\",&py,\"py/F\");\n   t1.Branch(\"pz\",&pz,\"pz/F\");\n   t1.Branch(\"random\",&random,\"random/D\");\n   t1.Branch(\"ev\",&ev,\"ev/I\");\n\n   //fill the tree\n   for (Int_t i=0;iRannor(px,py);\n     pz = px*px + py*py;\n     random = gRandom->Rndm();\n     ev = i;\n     t1.Fill();\n  }\n\n  //save the Tree header. The file will be automatically closed\n  //when going out of the function scope\n  t1.Write();\n}\n\nvoid tree1r()\n{\n   //read the Tree generated by tree1w and fill two histograms\n\n   //note that we use \"new\" to create the TFile and TTree objects !\n   //because we want to keep these objects alive when we leave this function.\n   TFile *f = new TFile(\"tree1.root\");\n   TTree *t1 = (TTree*)f->Get(\"t1\");\n   Float_t px, py, pz;\n   Double_t random;\n   Int_t ev;\n   t1->SetBranchAddress(\"px\",&px);\n   t1->SetBranchAddress(\"py\",&py);\n   t1->SetBranchAddress(\"pz\",&pz);\n   t1->SetBranchAddress(\"random\",&random);\n   t1->SetBranchAddress(\"ev\",&ev);\n\n   //create two histograms\n   TH1F *hpx   = new TH1F(\"hpx\",\"px distribution\",100,-3,3);\n   TH2F *hpxpy = new TH2F(\"hpxpy\",\"py vs px\",30,-3,3,30,-3,3);\n\n   //read all entries and fill the histograms\n   Long64_t nentries = t1->GetEntries();\n   for (Long64_t i=0;iGetEntry(i);\n     hpx->Fill(px);\n     hpxpy->Fill(px,py);\n  }\n\n  //we do not close the file. We want to keep the generated histograms\n  //we open a browser and the TreeViewer\n  if (gROOT->IsBatch()) return;\n  new TBrowser();\n  t1->StartViewer();\n  // in the browser, click on \"ROOT Files\", then on \"tree1.root\".\n  //     you can click on the histogram icons in the right panel to draw them.\n  // in the TreeViewer, follow the instructions in the Help button.\n}\n\nvoid tree1() {\n   tree1w();\n   tree1r();\n}\n\n\nSo, let's assume that you have cooked up a tree using the mini-code above, or you have a tree of your own. Below is a snippet of Python code that will read info from the branches of your tree and prints some extracted information to the screen. If you are interested, you can try to visualize the data in histograms. \nfrom ROOT import TFile\n\n# open the file\nmyfile = TFile('tree1.root')\n\n# retrieve the ntuple of interest\nmychain = myfile.Get('t1')\nentries = mychain.GetEntriesFast()\n\nfor jentry in xrange(entries):\n    # get the next tree in the chain and verify\n    ientry = mychain.LoadTree(jentry)\n    if ientry \nWriting a tree\nWriting a ROOT TTree in a Python session is a little convoluted, if only because you will need a C++ class to make sure that data members can be mapped, unless you are working with built-in types. Here is an example for working with the latter only:\nfrom ROOT import TFile, TTree\nfrom array import array\n\nh = TH1F('h1','test',100,-10.,10.)\nf = TFile('test.root','recreate')\nt = TTree('t1','tree with histos')\nmaxn = 10\nn = array('i',[0])\nd = array('f',maxn*[0.])\nt.Branch('mynum',n,'mynum/I')\nt.Branch('myval',d,'myval[mynum]/F')\n\nfor i in range(25):\n    n[0] = min(i,maxn)\n    for j in range(n[0]):\n        d[j] = i*0.1+j\n        t.Fill()\n\nf.Write()\nf.Close()\n\nThe use of arrays is needed, because the pointer to the address of the object that is used for filling must be given to the TTree::Branch() call, even though the formal argument is declared a ’void*'. In the case of ROOT objects, similar pointer manipulation is unnecessary, because the full type information is available, and TTree::Branch() has been Pythonized to take care of the call details. However, data members of such objects that are of built-in types, still require something extra since they are normally translated to Python primitive types on access and hence their address cannot be taken.\nCreating your own classes\nA user’s own classes can be accessed after loading, either directly or indirectly, the library that contains the dictionary. One easy way of obtaining such a library, is by using ACLiC. Let's first make up a very small class, by putting in a file MyClass.C the following code\nclass MyClass {\npublic:\n\nMyClass(int value = 0) {\nm_value = value;\n}\n\nvoid SetValue(int value) {\nm_value = value;\n}\n\nint GetValue() {\nreturn m_value;\n}\n\nprivate:\n    int m_value;\n};\n\nCreate the shared library using ACLiC:\nroot -e 'gInterpreter->LoadMacro(\"MyClass.C++o\");' -q\n Optimization or debug symbols ?Anyone have any idea what the difference is between \nroot -e 'gInterpreter->LoadMacro(\"MyClass.C++o\");' -q\nand\nroot -e 'gInterpreter->LoadMacro(\"MyClass.C++g\");' -q\n Drum rollClick to expandUsing o, we specify to the compiler to use optimization for speed. Using g, we specify to the compiler that we want to enable debug symbols. Confused by this? Check out Part 9 of this tutorial, 'Best Practices', where there is a lot of information about this!\n\nWe have now compiled our class. If we want to access it with Python, we can e.g. do\nfrom ROOT import gSystem\n\n# load library with MyClass dictionary\ngSystem.Load('MyClass_C')\n\n# get MyClass from ROOT\nfrom ROOT import MyClass\n# use MyClass\nm = MyClass(42)\nprint(m.GetValue())\n\nYou can also load a macro directly, but if you do not use ACLiC, you will be restricted to use the default constructor of your class, which is otherwise fully functional. For example:\nfrom ROOT import gROOT\n\n# load MyClass definition macro (append '+' to use ACLiC)\ngROOT.LoadMacro('MyClass.C')\n\n# get MyClass from ROOT\nfrom ROOT import MyClass\n\n# use MyClass\nm = MyClass()\nm.SetValue(42)\nprint(m.GetValue())\n\n So ... why would I use this?Whether or not you to use PyROOT is fully up to you: most people find the syntax easier than that of C++, and of course on does not have to worry about memory management when you use Python. \nWith the advent of ROOT6, an attractive feature of PyROOT can be speed\n\nCLING will compile your macro's line-by-line, which can sometimes lead to sluggish execution\nPyROOT is interpreted \n\nPython code is often ran as an interpreted language, it can be compiled, but you do don't need to compile it. Interpretation of macros is often much faster than compilation plus execution, unless the performance gain gained by compiling out-weighs the time the compiler spends on compiling the code. Since macro's are often intended to do only simple things (or call optimized libraries to carry out the heavy work, such as fitting), interpretation often suffices. \n\n"},"analysis/bestprac/best_prac.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/best_prac.html","title":"Part 9 - Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"Best practices\nIn this section, which probably we will not have time for to cover, some best practices are covered that are aimed at making your life easier.

As the name suggests:\n\nrelease builds are meant for production and should be used when running\nyour code at scale;\ndebug builds should be used exclusively when trying to sort out problems\nin the code.\n\nThere are two main correlated characteristics that differ between release and\ndebug builds:\n\ncompile-time optimization\ndebug symbols\n\nCompile-time optimization\nEvery compiler performs some form of optimization while producing executables\nand libraries. Optimizing a code while compiling means that the compiler does\nnot merely translate a written programming language into machine code, but it\nalso tries to interpret up to a certain extent what the code aims to do.\nAll levels of optimization have the result of avoiding unnecessary code to be\nexecuted, and since optimization requires some code analysis, compilation time\nis longer (even if this is mostly unnoticeable with modern computers).\nDifferent levels of optimization can be choosen, ranging from no optimization\nto aggressive optimization; the most common compilers (for instance, clang\nor gcc) you would use the following switches:\n[-O0|-O1|-O2|-O3|-Ofast|-Os|-Oz|-O|-O4]\nThe default optimization level for the aforementioned compilers is -O2:\nhigher levels of optimization are typically not recommended, as they might alter\nthe program flow to a point it does no longer match any longer the developer's\nintentions.\nA list of what each -O flag enables in GCC is available on the\nGCC documentation.\nWhen debugging code, you want binary instructions generated by the compiler to\nmatch as close as possible the readable code's flow. This is one of the reasons\nwhy optimization should be turned off in such a case.\n\nIncreasing the optimization does not necessarily lead to more efficient code!\n\"Extreme\" optimizations (like -O4) are not recommended and can even lead\nto unexpected results.\n\nSymbols and debug symbols\nShared libraries and executables contain binary code divided into \"sections\",\nand \"symbols\" are a way of referring to such sections. Each function or method\nname of your code is translated into a symbol.\nExtra \"symbols\" are written to a library when compiling in debug mode, pointing\ndirectly fragments of functions to the corresponding lines in the source code.\nTo compile with clang or gcc with debug symbols, you would use the -g\nswitch: there is no guarantee that optimizations are also turned off, so you'd\nbetter specify also -O0:\ngcc -O0 -g ...\n\nThe same flags are used for clang.\n  Compiling your ALICE code for debug Complex frameworks aren't typically built by directly invoking a compiler and\nits options: for instance, when compiling AliPhysics you use\naliBuild, managing\ndependencies between different packages, and CMake, a\ntool that generates compile commands based on the dependencies between source\nfiles inside the same project.\nA standard aliBuild compilation of AliPhysics, which is as simple as issuing:\naliBuild build AliPhysics\n\nwill use some \"defaults\" which, if no extra option is passed, are read from the\ndefaults-release.sh\nfile. Options\nin this file are such that we compile our three main packages (ROOT, AliRoot and\nAliPhysics) using both a normal optimization level (-O2) and debug symbols\n(-g).\n\nThe default configuration is sufficient in most cases and it is the same used\nfor Grid packages.\n\nYou have the option to use a different set of \"defaults\" for debug (note that\nthis will trigger a full recompilation of most packages):\naliBuild build AliPhysics --defaults debug\n\nSuch debug configuration uses -O0 and -g.\n\nYour analysis\nSuppose your analysis task is called AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask. In the macro\nyou use to load the analysis task, you can do:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask.cxx++g\");\n\nThe \"double plus\" forces recompilation, while the appended g tells ROOT to\ncompile the task with debug symbols. Once your code is in production, just\nremove the g:\ngROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliAnalysisTaskDummyTask.cxx++\");\n\nPlease note that debug code is considerably slower than production code,\nalthough it provides you with more information (for instance line numbers in\nstacktraces as we will see later).\n\nOnly use debug builds for temporary tests: turn off debugging when\nsending your code to production!\n\nGot Debug Symbols? (Linux only)\nTo check if your code has been compiled with debug symbols, on Linux you can\ndo:\nnm -a libName.so | grep debug\n\nThe nm -a command lists all symbols: we grep only the ones containing the\nword \"debug\". For instance:\n$> cd $ALICE_BUILD/lib/tgt_*\n$> objdump --syms libPWGEMCAL.so\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_aranges    0000000000000000              .debug_aranges\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_info    0000000000000000              .debug_info\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_abbrev  0000000000000000              .debug_abbrev\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_line    0000000000000000              .debug_line\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_str     0000000000000000              .debug_str\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_loc     0000000000000000              .debug_loc\n0000000000000000 l    d  .debug_ranges  0000000000000000              .debug_ranges\n\nThe library libPWGEMCAL.so on our reference Linux installation does\ncontain debug symbols. The above command usually contains no output if no\ndebug symbols are present.\nPlease note that on macOS debug symbols do not show up with nm -a.\n"},"analysis/bestprac/general.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/general.html","title":"Some general programming tips","keywords":"","body":"Some general programming tips\nIn order to reduce as much as possible the amount of time spent debugging and\nmaking your code faster, here are some general tips you might find useful.\nUse existing algorithms for general problems\nA large portion of coding problems applied to data collections can be reduced\nto sorting or searching: even if a simple custom made array sorting\ncode looks innocuous and easy to read, when iterating over a collection of\nthousands or millions of elements its drawbacks become pretty obvious.\nAs a general rule, do not write your own sorting algorithms: standard ROOT\ndata collections, like TLists and\nTObjArrays, already have an\nefficient Sort() method.\nMoreover, if you are manually filling a TList for sorting it at a later time,\nconsider using something like the\nTSortedList, which is\ncompatible with a TList, i.e. you can do:\nTList *mySortedList = new TSortedList();\n\nbut objects are inserted in the correct order every time you Add() them,\navoiding additional time waste to order it at a later time.\nThe same considerations apply for searching algorithms: ROOT already have\nsearch functions optimized for its data structures, and if you search in a\nsorted list (like the TSortedList), search is faster.\nSearching by strings inside large collections must be avoided at all times:\nstring comparison is a very expensive operation, and it is not easy to estimate\nhow long it takes since it depends on the length of the compared strings.\nMassive string comparison, even if this is unobvious, leads to:\n\nlarge data transfers between CPU, caches and memory, hitting the bus\nlimits\ncache trashing, i.e. the constant invalidation of the caches that are\nsupposed to speed up code execution\n\nA bad example that uses massively string comparisons has been found inside ROOT\nthanks to the IgProf profiler, and the code has been amended, as we will see\nlater on.\nTo improve lookups in large collections, please consider\nTHashList instead of TList: a\n\"hash\" is a fixed-size byte sequence (usually an integer) associated to each\nelement and computed based on the content of the element, constituting a sort\nof \"fingerprint\".\nWhen performing a lookup on a hash list (i.e. find what element is identical\nto this one, or find what element has this name), the hash (\"fingerprint\") of\nthe input element is calculated, and it is compared with the hash of every\nother element in the list.\nIf two hashes match, it might mean that the two elements are identical: in\nthis case, and this case only, a deep check is performed and the response is\nreturned.\nThe big advantage is that from a shallow (hash) comparison we can tell for sure\nif two elements are different, which saves us the time required to perform a\ndeep comparison for every element.\n\nUse optimized versions of the algorithms even if they are difficult to\nunderstand, and trust them!\n\nFor a list of optimized general purpose algorithms in C and C++, have a look at\nthe Numerical Recipes, which is considered the \"sacred\ntext\" of this field.\nObject ownership\nVery often, the ownership of pointers is not clear, i.e. who created a\ncertain object, and who is responsible of garbage collecting it?\nIf you are the person defining a new object, be sure to do something like:\nAliMyObject *mo = new AliMyObject();\n// code code code\ndelete mo;\n\nYou have probably heard it lots of times already, but it is worth repeating it:\nwrite a delete every time you write a new, and think in advance of how to\ndispose of an object you created.\nROOT collections (i.e. the TLists) can be made \"owners\" of objects:\nTList *l = new TList();\nl->SetOwner(kTRUE);\n// add add add\ndelete l;\n\nThis means that when the code reaches the delete line, delete is\nautomatically invoked on each of the contained objects, so that you do not have\nto do it manually.\nNew and delete, and hidden memory operations\nPlease note that new and delete operations are very slow: never ever create\nand destroy an object per loop (for instance inside the UserExec() of the\nanalysis tasks)!\n\nSave memory and CPU, recycle objects! And if the object classes\nare defined by you, write them in a way that you can redefine\ntheir content without the need to delete and recreate them!\n\nA bad example with objects constructed per loop:\nfor (x=0; x\nEven if new and delete are not used there (objects are on the stack), the\nTLorentzVectors have their constructor and destructor invoked per loop!\nThe amended code:\nTLorentzVector vec1;\nTLorentzVector vec2;\nTLorentzVector res;\n\nfor (x=0; x\nAs you can see, the\nTLorentzVector has various Set*() methods that make it not necessary to\ndestroy and recreate the object to set new coordinates.\nAlso, do not be too zealous when deleting: in particular, do not delete\nobjects that do not belong to you.\n\nCommon example: do not delete the object if you get its pointer from a\nTDirectory (like a TFile)!\n\nChoose the ROOT container carefully: even if a TList and a TObjArray are\nboth collections capable of expanding, lists are sparse in memory, as each\nelement points to the next (and sometimes to the previous); instead, arrays\nare contiguous collections of elements in memory.\nGrowing an array requires periodic hidden realloc() low level operations\n(luckily they do not happen for every element we add), and this might be rather\nimpairing when applied to a very large collection: use a TList in such a\ncase.\nROOT I/O and objects\nA note about ROOT objects (i.e. objects inheriting from TObject, i.e.\nmost likely your own objects): ROOT as you know needs a default constructor\nfor I/O that takes no arguments. You should create at least two\nconstructors in your code for clarity:\n\nThe default one, needed by ROOT, that should be called only by ROOT when\nstoring or restoring object from a file, and should never be used by the\nprogrammer directly: do not write any memory allocation instruction there,\nleave it as empty as possible!\nThe \"explicit\" one, taking at least one argument, which should do the actual\nstuff and should be used by the programmer when creating a new object.\n\nHistograms or trees obtained from a file with statements like:\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\n\nare related to the corresponding TFile, and they are destroyed when the\nfile is closed. So, do not do that:\nTFile *myFile = TFile::Open(\"myfile.root\");\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\ndelete myFile;\nhisto->Draw();\n\nThis is because TFile owns the pointer. You can detach the histogram from\nthe file:\nTFile *myFile = TFile::Open(\"myfile.root\");\ngROOT->cd();\nTH1F *histo = (TH1F *)myFile->Get(\"myHist\");\ndelete myFile;\nhisto->Draw();\n\nbut in this case you own the histogram and you must dispose of it:\n// when done...\ndelete histo;\n\nNote that you could also use histo->SetDirectory(0) for being able to close\nthe file, but it is better to attach it to the \"ROOT root directory\" in order\nto use it for instance in TTree::Draw.\nPlease note that there are in particular two objects that are automatically\nassociated to a TFile, mostly for performance reasons:\n\nHistograms (i.e. all objects inheriting from TH1)\nTrees (i.e. all objects inheriting from TTree, including the TNtuple)\n\nFor those categories of objects, the corresponding TFile owns the object. You\nmust always disassociate the object from the originating TFile if you\nwant to keep the object while closing the file.\n\nThis does not apply for objects that are neither histograms nor trees: in\nthat case (e.g a TList or a TGraph) you are responsible of\ndisposing of the object.\n\nCompiler warnings\nDo not overlook compiler warnings! Warnings should never exist in a\nclean code.\nWhenever you see a warning, you have to:\n\nfix the code, if it is actually broken: sometimes warnings get it right\nthat you are doing something wrong\nsilence the warning by rewriting the snippet in a way that it does not\ntrigger the warning.\n\nDifferent compilers give different warnings: clang is usually more precise and\ntends to give you advice on either how to silence the warning, or what you\nprobably meant when writing the code. Of course a compiler is a \"stupid\" piece\nof software and you should not always follow literally its advice, but do not\noverlook it!\nTwo good examples clarifying why warnings should not be ignored:\n\nStarting from GCC 5 many former warnings are turned into errors by default. We\nhave evaluated the opportunity to pass GCC 5 some flags to maintain the legacy\nbehavior (i.e. revert some errors into warnings) but we have found out that\nthe compiler was right: those warnings were actually faulty code that needed\nto be fixed. If the authors checked the warnings in the first place they would\nhave for sure recognized the logic errors in the code.\nWarnings clog compilation output and make more difficult to detect actual\nerrors when they occur.\n\nNote that by default aliBuild conceals the compilation output. You need to pass\nthe --debug option to actually see the warnings popping up:\naliBuild build AliPhysics --debug\n\nWhen to use pointers\nAs a general rule, it is not always a good idea to use pointers to objects as\ndata members of your class. If objects are big you are forced to use it, but\nfor many small objects you'd better use the object directly: you will save\nyourself (and the computer) a new/delete operation for each one of them. This\nhas an impact if you have many small objects.\nRemember to always initialize pointers used as data members: compilers should\nraise warnings if you do not.\nMany member pointers in custom classes are transient, i.e. they should\nexist only in memory and they should not be written to a file.  So please mark\nevery transient pointer with the appropriate special ROOT comment //! (no\nspaces between the slash and exclamation mark):\nclass MyClass : public TObject {\n  private:\n    AnotherClass *transient_ptr;  //!\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nThis comment is not just a decorator: you are telling ROOT not to save the\npointer to file, considerably reducing the output size!\n\nStrings\nA very very very bad habit found very frequently in analysis code is\nreferencing objects via their name inside the UserExec() (or any other loop):\nTH1I *h = list->FindObject(\"myHistoName\");\n\nThe FindObject() function is very (very!) expensive, furthermore it always\nreturns the same pointer for a certain object: it surely makes no sense to run\nit inside the UserExec()! Do this call once during the initialization and\nuse the cached result in the event loop!\nAlso, avoid passing \"raw\" strings as arguments to functions. Don't do:\nvoid MyClass::myfunc(TString a) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nDo instead:\nvoid MyClass::myfunc(const TString &a) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nNote that in both cases you invoke it with:\nmyfunc(\"this is a string\");\n\nwhich means that you can update your code without changing the way you call\nsuch functions.\nMoreover, it is a bad idea to use strings as triggering options on a method,\nlike:\nvoid MyClass::dosomething(const TString &what) {\n  if (what == \"this\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == \"that\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == \"something else\") {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nAs we have seen, string comparison is evil. Use enums instead:\nenum dowhat_t { THIS, THAT, SOMETHING_ELSE };\n\nvoid MyClass::dosomething(const dowhat_t what) {\n  if (what == THIS) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == THAT) {\n    // ...\n  }\n  else if (what == SOMETHING_ELSE) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\nThe code is as readable, but much more efficient.\n"},"analysis/bestprac/crash.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/crash.html","title":"Where does my code crash","keywords":"","body":"Where does my code crash?\nWhen the code you are running \"crashes\", you are usually presented with a\nbacktrace or stack trace showing the nesting level of the called\nfunctions plus some more or less \"obscure\" information.

fact that:\n\nAliRoot has been compiled with debug information: all AliRoot functions\nreport the corresponding source file and line number\nROOT has been compiled without debug information: all ROOT functions only\nreport obscure offsets\n\n\nIt is possible to mix non-debug and debug code, but we will obtain\ncomprehensible information only for the latter.\n\nIn the following sections we will present two commonly used debugging\ntechniques: one very simple based on printouts, and another one based on using\na debugger (gdb).\nDebugging with \"printf/cout\"\nThe simplest way to understand what goes on in your code is to introduce\nperiodic printouts stating the value of some variables, or simply indicating\nwhat the program is currently executing.\nPlease note that, while printouts may be useful, they surely clutter your code\nif abused: so if you end up adding one printout per code line, you'd better off\nwith a debugger, as explained in the next paragraph.\nApart from code cleanliness, printouts have a computational cost, which might\nbe non-negligible depending on the frequency of your output: we are about to\nlearn the appropriate way to add discrete debug printouts to your code in a\nway that:\n\nwe can turn them off when debug is over without additional computational costs\nwe don't have to write our code twice, one debug and one production version\n\nThe generic way\nThe simplest (and naive) way to do it in C/C++ is the following:\n// global variable\nbool gPrintDebug = true;\n\nvoid PrintDebug(const char *message) {\n  if (gPrintDebug == false)\n    return;\n  std::cout \nThe above snippet has a convenient PrintDebug() function, whose output can be\nsuppressed by simply setting the global variable gPrintDebug = false.\nHowever, the PrintDebug() function is called in any case, even if no output\nwill be produced, and this function call has a non-negligible cost; moreover,\nthe condition if (!gPrintDebug) must be tested every time, which has another\ncomputational cost.\nThe correct way is to use C/C++ preprocessor macros. The simplest way is to\nmove the condition if (!gPrintDebug) from C++ to the preprocessor:\n#include \n\n//#define PRINT_DEBUG\n\n#ifdef PRINT_DEBUG\nvoid PrintDebug(const char *message) {\n  std::cout \nIf we compile the above snippet, no call to the print function will ever be\ngenerated in the compiled code, because the condition is evaluated at compile\ntime by the code preprocessor (to be precise, this happens just before\ncompiling the code).\nTo enable print debug, you can either uncomment the #define line on top, or\ncompile the code with:\ngcc -o prog -D PRINT_DEBUG prog.cxx\n\ni.e. you can define the PRINT_DEBUG preprocessor variable on the command\nline without modifying your code.\n\nThere are fancier ways to use preprocessor macros for debug: this\none is trivial and provided as an example.\n\n The AliRoot way: AliDebug AliRoot has a logging facility defined in STEER/STEERbase/AliLog.{h,cxx}:\nthere are different functions defined there that allow you to add sensible\nprintouts to your code, and you should definitely use them instead of cout or\nprintf.\nThe \"functions\" are preprocessor macros, and there is a variable associated to\neach of them, determining whether the code for the printout should be generated\nor not ar runtime:\n\n\n\nFunction\nVariable\n\n\n\n\nAliDebug(level, message)\nLOG_NO_DEBUG\n\n\nAliInfo(message)\nLOG_NO_INFO\n\n\nAliWarning(message)\nLOG_NO_WARNING\n\n\nAliError(message)\nnone\n\n\nAliFatal(message)\nnone\n\n\n\nBy defining the LOG_NO_* variables (through #define, for instance) it is\npossible to suppress all the related message outputs, but in a way that the\ngenerated code is optimized as explained in the previous paragraph.\nPlease note that:\n\nit is not possible to suppress error and fatal error messages\nyou must use those macros in a class\nyou must include AliLog.h for using them\nyou can turn them on and off selectively per class\n\nConsider the following minimal example (save it as AliLogTest.h):\n//#define LOG_NO_INFO\n#include \"AliLog.h\"\n\nclass AliLogTest : public TObject {\n  public:\n    AliLogTest() {\n      AliInfoF(\"I am %s\", \"legend\");\n    };\n  ClassDef(AliLogTest, 1);\n};\n\nLoad it via the following load.C macro:\n{\n  gSystem->AddIncludePath(\"-I$ALICE_ROOT/include\");\n  gROOT->LoadMacro(\"AliLogTest.h++\");\n  AliLogTest a;\n}\n\nRun:\naliroot -q load.C\n\nand see what happens if you uncomment the LOG_NO_INFO definition.\nPlease note that in the example above we have used a function called\nAliInfoF() (and not AliInfo()): this is not a typo.\nEach one of the aforementioned log functions has a *F version (where \"F\" is\nfor \"formatting\"), accepting the same arguments of printf (for instance, %s\nfor strings or %d for signed integers). The following two calls produce the\nsame output:\nAliInfoF(\"The goat sleeps %s\", \"on the bench\");\nAliInfo(Form(\"The goat sleeps %s\", \"on the bench\"));\n\nbut they do different things. The AliInfoF() function roughly\ntranslates to:\n// AliInfoF(message, ...)\n{\n  TString formattedMessage;\n  formattedMessage.Form(message, ...);\n  AliInfo( formattedMessage );\n}\n\nwhich allocates a TString object used as a buffer for formatting the string.\nThe Form() call, instead, uses a preallocated common circular buffer of a\ncertain, uncontrollable size: so, AliInfoF() is safer if you have to\nformat very very long strings and you fear you might overwrite the buffer or\nget your part of the buffer overwritten by something else.\n\nOn single core programs, no one overwrites your buffer before you print it\nout: you might have problems with multithreading.\n\nIn general, using the full AliInfo(Form()) is better as it does not\ncreate and destroy an object, which is costly. If you do not want to use the\ncircular buffer but also don't want to create a buffer for each call, you can\nalso allocate your own buffer once and reuse it:\nTString myBuffer;\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 1) );\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 2) );\nAliInfo( myBuffer.Form(\"the string %d\", 3) );\n\nPlease also note that the LOG_NO_INFO define has the effect of suppressing\nalso the code generation for whatever the argument of AliInfo() is. So, if\nyou have:\n#define LOG_NO_INFO\n#include \"AliLog.h\"\n// ...\nAliInfo( Form(\"something %s, something %s\", \"borrowed\", \"blue\") );\n\nthe Form() code will not be generated.\nAs a general rule:\n\nuse AliInfo( Form() )\nrevert to a shared buffer, or AliInfoF() if you get garbled output\n\n\nChoose AliInfo() or AliInfoF() according to your needs, but be\naware of what they do under the hood!\n\nChoosing a \"debug level\"\nAliLog allows you to set the \"importance\" of your debug message, which is\ncalled the debug level: depending on the settings, you can decide to only\nprint important messages, i.e. messages with a debug level equal or greater\nthan whatever you decide.\nDebug messages are printed using AliDebug(), and the corresponding\nAliDebugF() function for printf-formatted messages. Syntax:\nAliDebug(level, message);\nAliDebugF(level, formatstring, [arg1[, arg2...]]);\n\nlevel is a positive integer setting the debug level: greater means\n\"more important\".\nThe global debug level is used to decide which messages to print.\nUse:\nAliLog::SetGlobalDebugLevel(level);\n\nOnly messages with a level greater than or equal to level will be\nprinted out.\nThe SetGlobalDebugLevel function is a static function, so you\nshould literally use it prefixed by AliLog::.\n\nUsing a debugger\ngdb is the GNU debugger. To install it on\nDebian-based distributions (like Ubuntu):\napt update\napt install gdb\n\ngdb and OS X\nSince some time, OS X moved to LLVM. In general, code compiled with LLVM\ncompilers cannot be debugged easily with gdb, although it is claimed now and\nthen to be compatible.\nLLVM comes with a new debugger called lldb: for the\nbasic operations, lldb's commands and its way of funcitoning are very similar,\nif not identical in some cases, to gdb.\nThe debugging example that follows contains examples and references to both gdb\nand lldb, and enough information on how to use the latter if you come from gdb.\nJust for reference,\nhere's how to install gdb on OS X\nproperly.\n\nIt is recommended you get accustomed with lldb if you use a Mac, and refrain\nfrom using gdb, as it lacks official support.\n\nTest case: a program that crashes\nConsider the following snippet:\n#include \n\n#define FLOAT_ARY 12\n\nvoid crash_function() {\n  unsigned int answer_to_everything = 42;\n  int another_number = -answer_to_everything;\n  float many_floats[FLOAT_ARY];\n  int counter_max = 10000;\n  const char *test_string = \"oh no, not again!\";\n  std::cout \n\nName it crash.cxx and compile it with debug symbols. On Linux:\ng++ -g -O0 -o crash crash.cxx\n\nOn OS X:\nclang++ -g -O0 -o crash crash.cxx\n\nThis code contains an array of floats, allocated \"on the stack\" (i.e. on the\nfunction's memory), which has space for 12 elements:\nfloat many_floats[12];\n\nHowever in the for loop we are writing way beyond its length in order to\nartificially generate a crash. Let's run it:\n$> ./crash\n...\nsetting index 811 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 812 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 813 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 814 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 815 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nsetting index 816 out of 10000. string is: oh no, not again!\nSegmentation fault: 11\n\nThe program crashes at a random point as expected.\n\nWe did not obtain any stack trace automatically: this is a peculiarity of\nROOT programs.\n\nWe want to run the program under a debugger in order to:\n\nobtain a stack trace\nsee the value of the variables at the moment of the crash\n\nLoad the program under gdb:\ngdb --args ./crash\n\nOn OS X you might use lldb:\nlldb -- ./crash\n\nFrom the gdb or lldb prompt, run the program by typing run: when the program\ncrashes, we are back at the debugger's prompt.\nHere is the sample output from lldb (gdb's output is very similar):\n* thread #1: tid = 0x13c1d0, 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x7fff5fc00000)\n    frame #0: 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14\n   11        std::cout  14          many_floats[i] = 0.12345;\n   15        }\n   16        std::cout The debugger is pointing us exactly to the line where the execution has\nstopped: since we have compiled the program with debug symbols, we have this\nprecise reference and the debugger can even show us the code snippet.\nTo manually show the code snippet, type list (both gdb and lldb). By pressing\nEnter on the empty prompt you are repeating the last list command that\nadvances in the code until the end of file is reached.\nTo reset code listing to the beginning, type list 1.\nPrint a backtrace by typing bt:\n* thread #1: tid = 0x13d53e, 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=2, address=0x7fff5fc00000)\n  * frame #0: 0x0000000100000ee8 crash`crash_function() + 280 at crash.cxx:14\nPrint the list of local variables available in the current program context with\nframe variable (lldb):\n$> frame variable\n(unsigned int) answer_to_everything = 42\n(int) another_number = -42\n(float [12]) many_floats = ([0] = 0.123450004, [1] = 0.123450004, [2] = 0.123450004, [3] = 0.123450004, [4] = 0.123450004, [5] = 0.123450004, [6] = 0.123450004, [7] = 0.123450004, [8] = 0.123450004, [9] = 0.123450004, [10] = 0.123450004, [11] = 0.123450004)\n(int) counter_max = 10000\n(const char *) test_string = 0x0000000100001f14 \"oh no, not again!\"\n(unsigned int) i = 436\n\nPrint the value of a variable at this point in the program (both lldb and gdb):\n$> print global_int\n(int) $0 = 789\n$> print test_string\n(const char *) $1 = 0x0000000100001f14 \"oh no, not again!\"\n\nWe can manually set a \"breakpoint\" in the program to stop before executing a\ncertain line of code, then we can advance manually from there.\nLet's start by killing the current running process:\nkill\nSet a breakpoint when calling the function func1(). With lldb:\nbreakpoint set -b func1\nWith gdb:\nbreak func1\nOr, as an alternative, we can set the breakpoint to a certain line of code.\nWith lldb:\n$> breakpoint set -l 28\nBreakpoint 1: where = crash`func1() + 15 at crash.cxx:28, address = 0x0000000100000f9f\n\nWith gdb:\n$> break set 28\nBreakpoint 1 at 0x100000f9f: file crash.cxx, line 28.\n\nNow run the program with run. It will stop where we told it to stop, even if\nit did not crash: since the execution is stopped, we can do many things:\n\nexamine the variables\nadvance line by line\nresume the normal execution\ndelete the breakpoint\n\nFor instance, we set the breakpoint before incrementing the variable\na_variable of one unit: let's print its value:\n$> print a_variable\n$0 = 456\n\nProcess next line with next, or simply n, then examine again:\n$> n\n$> print a_variable\n$1 = 457\n\nThe variable was correctly incremented by one unit like expected. To resume\nnormal execution just type continue (our demo program will continue until the\ncrash).\nCurrent breakpoints can be listed. On lldb:\n$> breakpoint list\nCurrent breakpoints:\n1: file = '/tmp/crash.cxx', line = 28, locations = 1, resolved = 1, hit count = 1\n  1.1: where = crash`func1() + 15 at crash.cxx:28, address = 0x0000000100000f9f, resolved, hit count = 1\n\nOn gdb:\n$> info breakpoints\nNum     Type           Disp Enb Address            What\n1       breakpoint     keep y   0x0000000100000f9f in func1() at crash.cxx:28\n    breakpoint already hit 1 time\n\nWe can delete a breakpoint, or disable it if we don't want it to be effective\nbut we might want to restore it later. With lldb:\n$> breakpoint delete 1\n$> breakpoint disable 2\n$> breakpoint enable 2\n\nWith gdb:\n$> delete 1\n$> disable 2\n$> enable 2\n\nWe have now learned how to perform the basic operations with two different\ndebuggers: stopping the program's execution and checking on the variable\nvalues.\nWithout a debugger those operations are commonly done by adding printouts,\ninput requests, etc.: we now know how to obtain the same results without\nmodifying our code.\nCommands summary\n\n\n\ngdb\nlldb\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nrun\nrun\nstart execution\n\n\nquit\nquit\nexit debugger\n\n\nbreak\nbreakpoint set [-l/-f...]\nset a breakpoint\n\n\ndelete\nbreakpoint delete\ndeletes a breakpoint\n\n\ninfo breakpoints\nbreakpoint list\nlists current breakpoints\n\n\nenable\nbreakpoint enable\nenable a breakpoint\n\n\ndisable\nbreakpoint disable\ndisable a breakpoint\n\n\ncontinue\ncontinue\nresume a stopped execution\n\n\nkill\nkill\nterminate current execution\n\n\nlist\nlist\nshow source code\n\n\nprint\nprint\nprint value of a variable\n\n\n\n\nA complete list of gdb vs. lldb commands can be found on the\nofficial lldb documentation.\n\n"},"analysis/bestprac/memory.html":{"url":"analysis/bestprac/memory.html","title":"Finding memory leaks","keywords":"","body":"Find memory leaks for ROOT object: TObjectTable\nROOT has a special class, called TObjectTable, which optionally keeps track\nof all new and delete operations invoked on a ROOT object, or, in other\nwords, any object that inherits from TObject.\nHooks are present in the TObject constructor and destructor to increment and\ndecrement a counter for the specific object you are creating or destroying.\nThis operation is computationally expensive, so you have to manually turn it on\nbefore starting ROOT.\nYou can create a .rootrc file in the current directory, or edit the\n$ROOTSYS/etc/system.rootrc file, and enable the memory and object tracking\nlike this:\nRoot.MemStat: 1\nRoot.ObjectStat: 1\nInside ROOT, you can then tell the program at any point to print the current\nnumber of objects by using the gObjectTable singleton:\n$> gObjectTable->Print()\nclass                     cnt    on heap     size    total size    heap size\n\nTKey                        4          4       72           288          288\nTClass                     84         84       80          6720         6720\nTDataMember               276        276       24          6624         6624\nTObject                    11         11       12           132          132\nTMethod                  1974       1974       64        126336       126336\nTDataType                  34         34       56          1904         1904\nTList                    2328       2328       36         83808        83808\nTH1F                        1          1      448           448          448\nTText                    2688       2688       56        150528       150528\nTGaxis                      1          0      120           120            0\nThe cnt column is very useful as it gives you the number of instances of a\ncertain class: if you, for instance, forgot to delete an object, you would see\nthat number constantly increasing and you would notice it quite easily.\n\nRemember to turn MemStat and ObjectStat off when done! They are very\nheavy for production operations.\n\nValgrind\nValgrind is a complex and robust tool to perform code\nanalysis and profiling.\nValgrind is composed of many tools, each one of them performing a different\ntask. The two tools we are interested in are:\n\nmemcheck: the memory checker\ncallgrind: a performance profiler\n\nInstalling Valgrind on Ubuntu is easy:\napt install valgrind\n\nOn OS X it is easy as well. With Homebrew:\nbrew install valgrind\n\nMemory check\nMemory checks with Valgrind are useful to find the following memory\nproblems:\n\ninvalid memory reads\ninvalid memory writes\npotential memory leaks\n\nValgrind will indicate the potential problems in the logfile it\nproduces. Since it can be hard to understand the logfile, there are\nalso graphical tools showing:\n\nmemory trends (with respect to running time): useful to see when and\nhow the memory grows\nallocation peaks: useful to see which are the parts of your code\nmaking the most memory allocations\n\nWe recommend using the massif-visualizer tool. On Ubuntu 14.04, it can be\ninstalled by\ngetting it from the Kubuntu repositories:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install massif-visualizer\nRun your program under Valgrind's memory check. The following command\nis suitable for AliRoot (see man valgrind for more details):\nvalgrind \\\n  --tool=memcheck \\\n  --error-limit=no \\\n  --max-stackframe=3060888 \\\n  --suppressions=$ROOTSYS/etc/valgrind-root.supp \\\n  --leak-check=no \\\n  --num-callers=40 \\\n  --log-file=/tmp/valgrind_memory.log \\\n  aliroot -b -q launchMyAnalysis.C+\n\nA couple of notes.\n\nThe --suppressions switch is used to tell Valgrind which alleged\nmemory problems to ignore. The file we pass to it is the ROOT\nsuppressions file, and greatly simplifies the produced output by\nreducing false positives.\nThe --leak-check=no makes the execution much faster, but it does\nnot check for memory leaks. Use --leak-check=full for a deeper\ninspection, but expect a longer running time.\n\n\nValgrind traps all memory operations through an internal \"virtual\nmachine\": this is why it can be up to 40 times slow. Run your\nprogram under Valgrind on a very small dataset!\n\nTo produce data readable with the massif-visualizer, use\n--tool=massif, which invokes the\nmassif heap analyzer\ninstead of memcheck.\nAn example of the interactive output produced by massif-visualizer is\npresented:\n\nPerformance profiler\nValgrind has a performance profiler called\ncallgrind. Its\npurpose, like IgProf, is to analyze how much time is spent in each\nfunction. As we have already discussed, being a deterministic tool\nevery single function of your program is trapped and captured, which\nmakes the tool very precise, but also very slow.\nCallgrind's output can be analyzed by means of the KCachegrind program\nthat can be installed on Ubuntu 14.04 with:\nsudo apt install kcachegrind\n\nThe typical way of invoking Valgrind's callgrind for AliRoot programs is:\nvalgrind\n  --tool=callgrind \\\n  --log-file=/tmp/valgrind_callgrind.log \\\n  aliroot -b -q launchMyAnalysis.C+\n\nThe produced output can be browsed interactively by means of KCachegrind. An\noutput similar to the following is presented:\n\nwhere colored blocks indentify graphically which are the functions where your\nprogram spends most of its time.\n"}}}
